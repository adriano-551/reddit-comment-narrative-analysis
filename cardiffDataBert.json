Yesterday my poor mum (mid-60s) fell down the stairs. Hurt her leg, banged her head, hurt her back. She called 999 at 12:05 (noon) and was told not to move as it was a suspected spine/neck injury and there could be a concussion, stay warm, and they'd send an ambulance as son as one was available. So my dad fetched a warm blanket and some more layers to try and make her a bit more comfortable at the bottom of the stairs. Now, I know the NHS is stretched at the moment, but I didn't realise it was this bad. Despite a few courtesy phonecalls to say she hadn't been forgotten about but without being able to provide ay ETA, the ambulance didn't arrive until 11:30pm. For 11.5 hours my poor mother had to stay at the bottom of the stairs, in pain, and not moving. After taking her away by ambulance around midnight, she didn't get into the assessment unit at the Heath until 3am. We all know we have to be careful with social distancing etc at the moment, but if a woman with suspected spine/neck/head injuries has to lie waiting for an ambulance for almost 12 hours then the NHS in Cardiff ***in general*** is far beyond stretched. Luckily they haven't identified any serious head, neck or back injury, and it's only (?!) a nastily broken leg. But just a cautionary note, look after yourselves because if you find yourself needing accident &amp; emergency support, you could be in for one hell of a wait.", "label": 1}, {"post": "Hi can anyone recommend a mobile mechanic please?

So I'm Cardiff born and bred but pretty naive when it comes to adulting if I'm honest, but I am getting better and since the pandemic I've really started to save much more effectively and shop wiser. I currently live in a house share and my rent is inclusive of all bills including council tax, so now that I'm interested in moving out and renting somewhere on my own I have no idea what the cost could look like because I've never had to worry about those things separately. I want to be realistic and make sure I'll be able to afford it but in my experience when I've had viewings in the past, estate agents are always a bit vague about monthly costs after rent. Ideally, I don't want to pay more than £800 for rent and all bills including council tax, but I don't know if this is realistic. I've been thinking like you can get some decent places close to town for £550-£600 and then I'm not sure if allowing another £200 on top of that would realistically cover council tax, electricity, gas, water, broadband and TV license etc. Or if it would cost more? I really don't know where to look or how to start working this out. I'm also saving to eventually buy somewhere, so £800 on rent and bills allows me to still put some money aside for saving and to have enough money to buy food and essentials. I don't want to bother leaving the houseshare if renting my own place is going to cost much more than £800 because then I'll be worse off in terms of savings, although I do feel like I'd be mentally better off living alone than with housemates at the moment. Both of which are important things battling eachother in my mind right now haha. One of my friends who is renting a place with her boyfriend said they pay almost £200 per month for their council tax and that they only pay it for 8 months of the year. I've looked at the council website and tbh I just can't really make head nor tail of it right now. If anyone could point me in the right direction of where to look or give me an idea whether £800 for rent and all bills is doable It'd be much appreciated!

Overpriced/underwhelming selection given the competitiveness of the Cardiff craft scene. **The Goat Major** - there is/was black mould all over the interior wall by the door?

Unfortunately she know the room was going to be free until AFTER I signed with this fella. I like the place in Penarth, I also went to her place in Gileston and I bloody well like it too! I obvs like her too, I've struck up a decent rapport over the past few years. Now (a) I'm torn as to which is the better bet? (b) If I was to pick the other place in Gileston, is there any way of breaking out of the contract before the tenancy has started (1st Nov move in date) and getting my refund in full or am I well and truly committed to Penarth. &amp;#x200B; FWIW, I'm still not 100% on the pros/cons for each so if you guys do then feel free to add yours in for the list below! &amp;#x200B; **Pros (Penarth):** \\- Lively and vibrant; \\- Not far from Cardiff; \\- Probably more suitable for a 23 year old fresh out of uni; \\- Probably better for someone of an ethnic minority (I've had some dodgy experiences in pubs further out into the Vale/Valleys) **Cons (Penarth):** \\- Deposit. It won't cause me hardship and I won't miss it but hey... it's 500 quid at the end of the day. I guess. \\- Don't know the fella renting. Seems like a sound bloke though! \\- Is there really any actual disadvantage? &amp;#x200B; **Pros (Gileston):** \\- It's a nice room (as is the other); \\- I like the landlady. She's generally gone out of her way to make it very much a 'home' than simply 'a room' and if I had the time to do decorating I'd be allowed to do that if I wanted (within reason); \\- Landlady is willing to drop my rent below if I can get out of the contract (£20 ... every little helps when saving to buy your own gaffe!); \\- Can have the entire garage for my motorbike and doing up project motors that I want to flip for profit; \\- Can move in right now and my landlady understands that I'm on furlough (lite) atm. &amp;#x200B; **Cons (Gileston):** \\- Slightly increased fuel costs to work/the gym (Penarth is far enough from the gym!!... gainz... 16.1 miles at it's greatest at our Cardiff site or 60mi at it's greatest at our Swansea site); \\- Longer commute depending on which site I'm working at - Cardiff or Swansea; \\- I'm not sure what they're like towards ethnic minorities near there. But I have been to Monknash on a ride out to the Vale and I found them a bit unwelcoming to say the very least. &amp;#x200B; I like to believe that I can go anywhere I want at this day and age, but I'm a young Black male (23) and alas that isn't always the case sadly so I'm mindful of that too! &amp;#x200B; Was wondering what r/Cardiff's thoughts were on this situation.", "label": 1}, {"post": "I did a couple of shifts for brew monster on the high street late last year but had to leave because there wasn't enough hours going. Anyway, the job I was hoping to get fell through and so I signed on. Everything was fine at first but a couple months down the line, after lockdown started, a noticeable chunk was removed from my benefit. So I went to my account and looked at the monthly statement from DWP, it said I'd received earnings (which I categorically had not). I checked my HMRC PAYE account and it said I'd been paid by brew monster, and not just the small sum I had received a couple of occasions from them, it was a large amount. The money you would expect a manager to receive. So I messaged the general manager, Tom, and he told me he'd also left the business to start a new career and had found them doing the same to him. He said they'd claimed furlough scheme payments against his N.I. and that he'd exhausted every avenue trying to resolve the situation with them, including his solicitor sending letters. He said he was taking them to court over the issue. Then he sent me the various reporting methods he had used, and interestingly he told me that the director of the company is also the accountant, and is a chartered accountant so he shouldn't have any excuse for misfiling accounts (not just once, but several times). That was in april. I messaged the new manager, Richard, and he said he'd look into it, but then kept kicking the can down the road. Every time I messaged it took days and multiple reminders to get a response, and each response was the same. Confusion, uncertainty, general mismanagement of the situation, and carefully worded messages in order to evade responsibility. Eventually I got fed up and I messaged the director of the company and asked for clarification on three occasions. He ignored those messages. Then I rang him and he picked up but when I told him what the call was about he hung up on me. I tried again from another phone and this time he told me the police would have done something by now if he was doing something wrong, then he hung up on me again. After lockdown had ended I walked past the bar a few times and spotted him on one occasion. When I confronted him he told me that if I came back he would kick my head in and warned me he \"used to do UFC\" (that's exactly what he said. Not MMA, UFC). Every single month since then I have had a statement from DWP followed by a two day window in which I have had to print bank statements and mail them to the DWP to have my benefit adjusted days later. This has forced me to pay some bills with credit cards and with my overdraft, as well as causing a fair whack of stress. I followed the former GM's advice (In his defence he was quite helpful despite having only known me briefly) and reported them to HMRC, the fraud line, companies house, and cardiff council, and so far nothing has worked. I get template email responses from these bodies saying they'll contact me if they take things further. I'm at my wits end now and thought I might turn to the community for advice. I'm angry, but not particularly interested in enacting revenge upon the business or the owner. I mostly want to be rid of them and would like to know that no one else is put through anything similar by them. Does anyone have any advice for me on how I can be absolutely rid of this awful company once and for all?", "label": 1}, {"post": "The council are planning to reinstate the Churchill Way Canal Dock Feeder as part of a 'One Planet Cardiff' On the Cardiff council website it states &gt; This will manage surface water in a more sustainable way and increase the opportunity for more trees and biodiversity alongside the route [ In the One Planet Cardiff document it states &gt; Restore the historic Cardiff City Centre water way as part of the redevelopment of the Canal Quarter masterplan Here's the One Planet Cardiff document (it's 14mb btw) [ So it be interesting to hear everyone's opinion regarding the canal.

If you want to live up to 200 years old or even longer. If you want to get richer, smarter and look more beautiful/handsome. Then this is a special gift and the most value information you can find on the internet in 2020. Most people are living based on old traditional and influenced by families, societies rather than the Earth environment and personal choice. You must change your lifestyle if you want to have a better life, there is no any other choice. I will you give some advice with little change, easy to do but with significant result like a magic wand. This is beyond any education you can receive or have learn so far about life. **Lifestyle** \\- Remove all the hair in your all body as much as possible from legs,hands to any sensitive spot. Because hair are just human body waste just like urine, shit. Unless you want to keep it for fashion,otherwise, there is no any reason to keep it. \\- Sleep when the moon is up (before 8 pm), and wake up when the sun start giving the light (around 6-7 am). The healing power is much stronger when the moon is up, and your body will be healed faster better during this time. \\- Take a bath 30  60 minutes everyday. Swimming pool is better than Bathtub is better than Shower. \\- Massage your body with your own hands without any tools. \\- Turn off, avoid television, computer, phones as much as possible. Only using it for communication with others or seeking for some information you really looking for. \\- Do not take any drugs, medicine, vaccines. **Diet** You must have an better diet with some time restriction, you cannot eat whatever whenever you want just like those animals. Instead, you should only have 1-2 meals a day, and each meal is within 30-60 minutes. **An example diet for 7 days you should try:** \\- 1 Day: Freestyle eat whatever at whenever you want. \\- 2 Day: 1 meal with only fresh raw fruits, vegetable, 1 meal with with cooked foods including both seafood and meat. \\- 2 Day 1 meal with raw fresh fruits,vegetables, 1 meal with cooked vegan products only. \\- 2 Day: both 2meals only with raw fresh fruits, vegetables.

I am from the US and am going to be looking for a place to live starting in September (preferably close to Cyncoed campus). A little bit about myself. I'm 22 and don't take up much space. I live a fairly minimalist lifestyle and am looking for the cheapest rent that is close to Cyncoed campus. I want to mention that I am in recovery which may raise some red flags but I have been working the program well and know how to set up a support system to avoid a relapse. The only reason I am able to make this opportunity happen is due to sobriety so that is my number one priority. Obviously not everyone is in recovery and I am fine being around alcohol but would prefer to not live in a house that throws huge parties often. Also, I lead sound meditations and practice yoga so I will have some Tibetan singing bowls but I like to practice outdoors so I won't be playing inside all through the night. I have also lived on my own in the US for several years now so I am able to carry my share of housework and want to keep the peace as much as possible.

Although municipal bonds provide many advantages, they also provide some risks and disadvantages. As an investor, you should understand the advantages and limitations of investing in municipal bonds to plan if they fit within your future or present financial condition. Keep more of your earnings The main benefit of investing in municipal bonds is the capability to keep more of your returns because of tax exemption. When you purchase a bond that is not exempt, you must pay taxes on your interest income. So, even though, you may earn an eight percent of return of your corporate bond, in actuality you earn less than that because of taxes. A municipal bond permits you to reject paying taxes on your interest income. In some cases, although the rate of return of a municipal bond is lower than the rate of return of a business bond, you can still earn more money interest investing in the municipal bond because of the cash you saved via the tax exemption. Low price volatility Tax-exempts bonds experience low price volatility, which makes them a remarkable investment for the objective of diversification. Although not fully risk free, municipal bonds are quite low-risk assets. Much of the low risk and price volatility of the bonds is derived from the municipalities' credit ratings. The low danger and price volatility specs are mainly attractive to senior investors looking for safe investment to save their retirement income. Anyway, investors should research municipal bonds before making investment plans. Interest rate and returns Compared to other bond types, municipal bonds provide quite low returns. The low returns of municipal bonds come from the fact that they are quite short-term, low-risk investments. Municipal bonds are also subject to interest rate danger, meaning that as interest rates rise, the market price of municipal bonds down. The longer the term of your municipal, the more uncovered you are to interest rate danger. Like other bonds, a municipality may call back a municipal bond if interest rate constantly drops. In the mind of the municipality, it favors to call the bond and reissue it at a lower rate to reject paying you a higher rate of return.

Do you think there will be any significant improvements in the cycling routes/ facilities and number of people actually regularly cycling following all this? I know the Westminster gov has announced the fund for cycling for England, and the equivalent scheme in Wales hasn't achieved much, or is this not the case?

Some restrictions in England were eased last week, and yesterday Mark Drakeford announced his road map for easing them in Wales. If Wales follow England, then the first steps are likely to be more people returning to work. This presents the question, how are you planning to get too and from work? The official government advice is to avoid Public Transport if at all possible, and estimates are that Public Transport could be limited to a 10% capacity. Indeed LNER yesterday announced that passengers will only be able to travel on their trains, by purchasing tickets in advance, so that they can limit the number of people on any given train at any given time. We expect more train companies, including TfW to follow a similar pattern. Even if Bus companies and TfW do not follow a similar pattern, their will still be some anxiety about travelling on potentially crowded public transport. So once again, how are you planning to get too and form work? Now is a perfect time to re-asses how you get too and from work. A contract booking is perfect for commuting. The surfaces in our vehicles are wiped with anti-bacterial wipes after EVERY booking. Our drivers have windows open, to ensure the car remains well ventilated. Payments are weekly, meaning there is no cash to handle, change to be passed back, or card machines to be touched, making for a totally contact less payment. It is also incredibly convenient. We allocate a driver to you, and it is the same driver almost every time. There is no need to make a new booking everyday, book once, and you are set. The price is fixed as well, so no need to worry about the fare being affected by Uber surges, or traffic etc. The same driver will turn up every day, at the same time, for the same price. Safer &amp; More Convenient. visit[for more information about a contract, Or email us: booking@personalclasstravel.com to see how we could help you return to work safely.How are you going to be getting about when restrictions in Wales are lifted?", "label": 1}, {"post": "hello! i'm looking for somewhere to take my daily walks that isn't bute or roath park/rec as i'm finding them increasingly busy and full of rude people who can't walk in single file! any suggestions for quieter/less frequented places?", "label": 0}, {"post": "Hi Cardiff !

I was informed that yes, they've broken many laws but as I was employed under 2 years, the law is on their side and I was entitled to nothing, except being advised to contact the police regarding 'theft' as my previous boss told me I couldnt not return even to collect my own belongings. I didnt do this at the time as I was distraught and have been on anxiety medication since, only now getting myself together. Since this happened I have found many people in Cardiff who worked for them at some time or another and have been treated badly, wages withheld or unfairly dismissed. This is just how they operate. I worked for them long enough to know the family who own it, the 3 staff members in one store and various other staff in the 2 other stores. I know that they break data protection laws: keeping customer's bank details in a book on the shop floor and food saftey practices - I was often instructed that food fallen on the floor should be put back on the shelf. They are viscous to anyone they think is a shoplifter- which is almost every customer, we were told to follow people around the tiny store - especially anyone dodgy-looking - which was basically anyone non-white. A mixed-race customer once told me she would never come back because the store racially profiled honest paying customers, and boy was she spot on. They are also really nasty toward any new, similar businesses and did a lot of bad-mouthing of Ripple and Cook Cardiff. They also love telling their new staff about all the people theyve fired, all accused of stealing without evidence. My first day they couldnt wait to tell me about the psycho girl they fired to get me in and laughed while telling me they refused to pay her. I should have known but I was so excited to work for what I thought was an ethical company. Shoppers see green and the word ethical or fairtrade and assume that everyone involved must be a good person. These are downright awful people masquerading as loving hippies What is the best way to take down a company that thinks they are above the law?

But it's sad to see yet another recent attempt at making the place more palatable for local families fall way short of being a success. It was quite poignant that the previous regime managing the non-local side of the boozer, saw it fit to bow out by burning the children's climbing frame as a bonfire last November. Now all that remains of the 'quite pleasant in the summer' beer garden is charred earth, overgrown grass and rotting wooden benches. You couldn't fault the previous team for effort, but the scatter gun approach at trying to please all punters without doing a few things really well rarely works out. I used to think, just make a damn good home made burger and become known for that! But instead the one burger I had their was without doubt mass produced, previously frozen, rubbery and spongy. Unpleasant... In 1469 Thomas Mathew built Radyr Court, which at the time was a manor house. The house was also used as a court. Although it was destroyed by a fire in the 19th century, the three large dungeons survived and can still be seen at the Inn.

BBC News - Cardiff council congestion plans amid pollution fears This could well spell the end of the Cardiff centre shopping district. Over a number of years the council have implemented numerous changes to the road network which have resulted in more congested roads and as a result, more pollution. Anyone who thinks that public transport is a viable alternative is looking through rose tinted glasses. The bus routes serve only the centre, not the city layout as a whole. The rail connections to Cardiff were poor 18months ago and service has only deteriorated since TfW have taken over. Late, short formed or cancelled services are the norm rather than the exception. The Cardiff shopping experience relies on both staff and customers from the Valleys, the Vale, and beyond to operate. On this basis, without a complete drains-up review/overhaul of the public transport network, this will stop people coming to the city. Against a context of businesses closing up due to a perfect storm of rising commercial rates, a downward trend in footfall and a shift to online shopping, this will be the nail in the coffin for many businesses, especially Cardiff's famed independent shopping arcades.

I am in the process of getting a new community organisation in Cardiff - called Cymbal - off the ground, and I am seeking *volunteers*! Not just the kind who do physical work - but all kinds: virtual volunteers to help find us more physical ones via social media, the kind who just write letters and make phone calls, volunteers who make tea for our meetings and just plain nice folk who want to give out hugs... you name it (...within reason...), I'm sure there'll be a space for it. It doesn't matter how much or how little you believe you can manage to give, either. That's kind of the point: this organisation is going to do a lot with very many very littles, as it were. But, if I have your attention, there is a caveat, I'm sure, for some of you. Cymbal is political. It *isn't* and *can't* be a charity because of the specific range of things we want to do and the law regarding charities; it will be a democratic political community organisation that just happens to do a lot of things that charities also do - first, in Cardiff, because that's where I live. And because of the starting mix of people, I can say with fair confidence that we will, at least initially, be *very* to the left; I suspect we will likely organise as a member co-operative, and I'll be advocating for a structure along those lines. Some of our early ideas for first efforts (to be submitted at the inaugural meeting for consideration) include: * Blankets, bedding, &amp; hot food handouts of some sort in the undoubtedly upcoming bad weather for people who spend much of their time on the streets - perhaps just joining up with other organisations who are already doing this to increase efficiency, too * A phone-and-letter campaign to get several lifts vital to the disabled and elderly at infrastructural locations around Cardiff fixed (one at Heath *Hospital* has been out of order reportedly for some months now!) * A project to source unwanted library books, and then remove all library material from inside them so they can be donated on to schools etc (a key problem libraries have is getting rid of old stock - they often have to just incinerate it because removal of marking material is a fair amount of work, and nice people return library books when they come across them...) * Networking with independent merchants around the city to see how/where we can leverage their support with future projects in ways that are beneficial to the community *and* the proprietors * A campaign to attempt to put pressure on local businesses, especially pubs, to remove signs marking toilets as for \"paying customers only\" - which is an anti-homeless dog whistle; pubs in particular have messy toilets regardless of who uses them, and really have no excuse to exclude people, especially given the lack of provision of public toilets in modern Britain * A campaign to support organisations in Cardiff by creating a database of what charitable or support services are available to which individuals under what circumstances, aiming to bring together data in one location, either under our control or operated by a pre-existing organisation where we provide the curated data and they publish * Later, providing man-hours to charities on a rotating, where-needed basis, in a similar manner to a temp agency, but with volunteers, by hooking up people who want to help in their community with ways to help that are needed *now*, reducing the workload for people who want to help and increasing the likelihood that good intentions will become good deeds * Campaigns to seek material donations from local businesses for local charities ...but this is all very nascent, and subject to *democracy*! If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. If you are interested in helping out *in literally any fashion* - even if it's just advice on stuff you think we'll need to know (and even if it turns out that you're wrong!). We want your help if you want to give it, no matter how little or how big. If you want to *volunteer*, please DM me and I'll keep you in the loop on the upcoming inaugural meeting (the first of which will be wholly open - after that it depends what we decide!) where we'll be really getting everything going.

I have located the entrance to the Friars' tunnel featured in the BBC documentary Hidden Cardiff, watch from the 3 minute mark: Essentially it is a 13th century tunnel which begins on a riverbank and heads in the direction of the castle but becomes blocked with soil after maybe 15 metres. I strongly suspect that it ends somewhere on the castle grounds. No one alive knows where it goes/ends and no one has been beyond the first blockage for many centuries. Since it is only soil my plan is to dig through with shovels, however doing this alone is risky in case something happens to me. Therefore I am seeking 1-2 people who are as curious as I am to find out what lies beyond, caving and/or urbex experience would be preferable but not necessary.

The M4 is dangerously congested with a high rate of accidents. Slow moving/idling traffic on the M4 is worse for local pollution levels. Arguments are made that people should ditch their cars and use more sustainable transport methods, but the public transport in South Wales is appallingly bad, also overcrowded, and doesn't service all routes that commuters take. From my POV, IF (big if) more sustainable, high volume public transport solutions had been put into progress prior to the decision then I would be more comfortable with it, but refusing to support the relief road while insisting that 'someone, at some point, will have to come up with better transport options' feels short sighted and like wishful thinking.

Is that true? My strategy is to be a transport led strategy due to the South Wales Metro coming in. My ideas are for the following: 1. Creating a new train station in the same place as where it is currently, except with a raised plaza above the train line (in red on the photo), to create a proper focal point for interaction, a proper village centre if you will, and to make the train station somewhere that is safe and fun to go to (maybe have space for some shops, and at least a tourist information, doctors, and a cafe). 2. Creating more parking, mainly focused on making the current parking at Taffs Well train station to be two or even three storeys. 3. To create two \"garden bridges\" (in green on photo) one going from said plaza over the proposed rail yard for the south wales metro, and the A470, to then go down to Cemetary Road to connect Ty Rhiw with a faster walk route to the train station, and the other going south, and connecting eventually to Merthyr Road at the start of Tongwynlais going over the roundabout. This to make walking to Castell Coch much easier than it is currently. This is a bit out there, but it would be two birds with one stone in that not only would it make walking through that area much easier and safer, but it would help beautify the area so that when you are looking down from Garth mountain that some of the industrial areas and roads would be covered by these garden bridges. 4. Make sure that the trails are better kept on the mountain with Castell Coch. 5. Better signage overall in the area to help tourists to get to Castell Coch, Garth Mountain, and the springs. 6. To investigate how to make the Taffs Well spring not contaminated, and look into opening it for real public use, with Cadw involvement. Am I on the right track?

We'll have people there playing on the warhammer tables (cost covered by the WGN for this), painting warhammer figures, we also take board games like Pandemic and Dead of Winter (new player friendly with co-op options!), and there are card games players. We're primarily a video game organization but our Cardiff tabletop meets are doing very well. The venue is Firestorm Games in Cardiff, which has toilets, cafe, bar, big shop, loads of tables and free entry. If you're heading there look for Nelinde who has blue hair so she's usually easily spottable! You can also find us by the Velindre Cancer Fundraising bucket (green), as we're officially partnered with Velindre to raise money for cancer support this year (Almost at £500 raised!!). We have a website and a 900 member Discord server full of friendly video and tabletop gaming folks in Wales - ", "label": 0}, {"post": "Anyone fancy watching it with me Monday?

Techniquest is obviously more geared towards families but on the 18th May we've organized a special event day. The WGN will be there with a stand giving out information and talking about games, and Perp Games (Wales Interactive) will be showcasing games. We'll also have 3 streamers from the WGN doing a live Q&amp;A, so for anyone interested in streaming on Twitch or meeting local streamers / making connections this is an opportunity we don't often have locally. We'll be hosting a fastest lap competition for Mario Kart on the SNES with a prize as well. We did this at Rapture Gaming Festival and things got very fast and competitive! There's gonna be more, we're still planning. Some photos and more details here Usual Techniquest entry prices apply, £8 adults £6.50 children, £7.20 over 60s or students, under 3s free, annual pass free. Techniquest itself is a charity so a good cause. And a sneaky reminder that we're fundraising for Velindre Cancer Centre so will have our trusty green bucket at the event and every few pennies help support those with cancer in South Wales.", "label": 0}, {"post": "Yes, sounds weird, but that's exactly what I saw at Culverhouse Cross on my way home this evening.

Just be warned, I will be a bit shy and quiet at first, but will open up once we've been talking for a while! I'm also not a great conversationalist, so it would be great if you like talking XD. I'm a great listener! About me: * All things superhero, sci-fi/fantasy, horror (horror stories like on [r/nosleep]( really want to try VR horror) * Anime, nerd conventions (I might cosplay at the next one!), Japanese language and culture, board/card games (really want to get into those games like D&amp;D, Risk, Settlers, etc), gaming videos, science videos * Science, astronomy, technology, the future. I love having deep and interesting conversations about these and all of the above! Especially about existence, the universe, and philosophy. You know, the sort of stuff you talk about while drunk/high XD. * Music (pop, funk, alt/indie rock, electronic music). Have never attended a music festival, which I really want to! I may be going to an edm gig next month in Bristol if anyone wants to join! It's my dream to go to Creamfields/Tomorrowland. It would be great to find someone to go with! * I also like days/nights out exploring, discovering more about the city, enjoying the sun, stargazing, restaurants, pubs, and clubs.

While away for easter holidays, our house was robbed, and some musical equipment was stolen, along with some other things.

If anyone possibly know of any music stores where you can sell equipment I would love to know where so we can go and check. And if you happened to have seen someone sell all this together somehow please let me know. It's a long shot but this really sucks so I'm trying everything.
