[{"post": "[ &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; what is her name?", "label": "0"}, {"post": "Hi! :) My real name is Tori. And although it might be kinda hard to believe given my line of work, Im actually a pretty shy girl- but I figured I would make this so you could get to know me better! Theres just one rule- no asking me if anyones told me I look like Missandei! Lol. [Here]( are some casual pictures of me if youre curious, since almost everything else I post here is NSFW. I have a couple funny quirks, like the fact that I prefer my water warm/hot over cold- it probably sounds gross to you, but it goes down easier for me! And for the heck of it, Ill name a few other things that usually seem to surprise people: I dont like chocolate, flowers, *or* steak, I havent seen The Godfather, Endgame, or Titanic, I have a forklift license but have never had a real license, Im not really interested in having any sort of fancy wedding ring or even having a wedding, and I think possums, snakes, and raccoons are *extremely* cute! I also have a wide array of sexual interests/kinks/fetishes/fantasies! My biggest are probably things like everything daddy kink related, spanking, sub/dom, size kinks (I like feeling small and overpowered) humiliation/degradation, petplay, ddlg, cnc, etc... I can get pretty intense, but mostly at the end of the day I just like feeling like a secretly naughty girl who needs to be kept in check by a firm-handed (figuratively and literally) daddy figure. Now, for some normie stuff! I have a (currently 6 months old) German Shepherd puppy named Koda, who has been my whole world ever since bringing her home. Some of my favorite things in the whole world include rollercoasters, cheesecake, pretty much anything Winnie the Pooh related, good hair days, and strawberry milk! I actually have no formal education past middle school. Due to unfortunate circumstances and a lack of support at home, I dropped out of high school when I turned 17, and got my GED (high school diploma equivalent) instead. I consider myself incredibly lucky to be able to live comfortably given my lack of higher education, but Ive worked hard to get where I am! When Im not spending time with my dog, relaxing and playing video games (overwatch on Xbox and pokmon go on my phone are my current favs!) or longingly window shopping at my favorite stores (guilty pleasure lol) I love coming up with random craftsy projects to keep myself busy. I habitually bite off more than I can chew, but it doesnt ever deter me from eventually scheming up the next silly idea. I got into NSFW content creating around the beginning of 2020 through a mix of curiosity, impulsiveness, and desperation to leave my former job at Amazon after a rough breakup left me feeling unmotivated in life. I never imagined I would make it this far, and be *this* much happier in life through something as controversial as posting myself naked online... But here I am! :P I love my job, and I love getting to make people happy through it every day. Feel free to ask anything else youre curious about in the comments! Just remember the first rule... ;P", "label": "1"}, {"post": "$45 off your first stay of $95CAD or more $17 off your first experience of $63CAD or more.

but this will do, haha.\" i purposely bent over in the skirt to unlock the passenger side. it'd taken him about 5 minutes over break to come out, so i said \"if we're going to do this we've got to be quick and careful\" (baring in mind i was parked right in the front of the building) he grabbed my hand and forced my head down on his cock and said \"haha, you slut. obviously this is what you want\" i'd only just become accustomed to sucking dick then, but god, did i love it. i loved the empowerment of taking a cock in my mouth and making it cum. i think this appealed to me more because the aforementioned boyfriend is the one who got me into doing it. so it felt like i was getting even more back on him. i sucked his dick, played with and squeezed his balls, while he put his hand up my skirt fingering my pussy. i was really close to coming (as was he) and i love to ride a guy to make him cum. he got within seconds of coming when i stopped, and said \"get in the back\" quickly. he crawled through the seat and i got on top of him, facing him. his dick was a bit bigger than the guy i was fucking at the time too, so that was a bonus. i wrapped my legs around the sides and rode him really really fast (about 20-30 seconds) and he goes \"you want me to pull out?\" of course i said \"fuck, no\" and made him cum deep inside me. i gave him a huge kiss when he came inside me and stayed on top til it went soft. i didn't have much to clean up either of us with in my car except a few baby wipes, but everyone will have known i was getting fucked anyway. i mean, obviously i WAS wanting to wear that to get fucked, wasn't i? so the boyfriend was right all along? i guess i am just a dirty little slut. i think maybe even sexier than some of the parts of this story is when i did drive up to see my boyfriend (who of course thought i didn't go out on halloween, thought i only wear that outfit for him) i sucked him off and rode him in the car that exact same week, while remembering i just had some other bigger dick inside me.. he even made the joke of \"you've got better at sucking dick, who you been practicing on??\" i think that got me off the most. well now on for part 2 since it follows so well. the same boyfriend in this story clearly didn't last for long after (that went without saying, didn't it??) to set a little backstory i was going through a hard time at the moment and my mom was in the hospital. i was getting in with another guy at the time but the ex (we'll call him josh since, well, his name was josh and it's easier than saying the ex all the time!) was still getting in touch all the time. the guy i was talking to was a bit longer distance, but it never bothered me. josh was still messaging me quite often on messenger, facebook, myspace etc etc. i ignored all of his messages, i just couldn't be bothered. i was at home by myself (with my mom being in hospital) and heard a knock at the door. i figured it'd be a parcel or something, so i went to the door in just my little skimpy shorts and pajama top. i opened it and to my surprise, there was josh standing right at the door. \"why haven't you been responding to my texts, tabitha?\" (yeah, he called me tabitha, my full name, i hated that.) i shrugged and said \"because i don't want to hear your shit when i have enough of my own?\" he soon realized i was distressed over my mom and had a little mercy. i let him in begrudgingly just for some company. i said something like \"i don't want you here long, we'll just talk and that's it.\" i guess maybe he had more up his sleeve. maybe it was getting me back for the past in the last story, but old flames sparked up and he started teasing me about the messages on my phone from my new guy. said stuff like \"oh i'm going to have to delete these pictures,\" \"delete his number\" blahblahblah, all the stuff i broke up with him for in the first place. i laughed and tried to grab my phone off of him. we wrestled for a minute and i already started to get a bit turned on. he started manhandling me, throwing me down. tickling me. and then spanked my ass. he knew i loved my ass spanked and it didn't take long til he was calling me a naughty girl. he pulled my pants down. now up until then he'd never been able to fully make me cum (i got close but no cigar) he pulled down my underwear and pants, and tried shoving his cock straight in me from behind. he couldn't get it in deep enough, so he grabbed me and turned me over in missionary and held me down by the throat. \"yeah, this is what a slut like you needs. you need my fucking dick inside you?\" i told him i needed it deeper. he grabbed my legs and put them as far up as he could go behind my head and pushed in deeper. my pussy could barely take it it was so deep. i asked him to pull back a bit but he wouldn't and my pussy got so tight it was literally lodged on his cock. i started to cum. i could feel he was about to too, and just when i thought he was he goes \"no, i'm going to pull out and cum on your tits, that's what a bitch likes you need. tell me you want it.\" i told him how bad i wanted in my pussy, but alas he pulled out and commanded me to push my tits together. he shot a huge load (maybe bigger than the first time he fucked me) all over my tits. i looked up at him loving it and rubbed it all in. this was pretty much what began of an all weekend sex fest... i let him stay up with me for a few days (until i just couldn't tolerate him when we weren't fucking anymore) i even sucked his cock while i was talking to the new boyfriend. i don't think i even wore panties once that weekend.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "Hi, I have a problem with kitra and my graphic tablet, sometimes or at least most of the time whenever I push the action \"mouse right click\" from my pen in the canvas, krita doesn't recognize it and doesn't show the pencils shortcut but it only happens with the pen in the canvas, the action works fine in any other software even in krita but I have to do it out of the canvas,", "label": "1"}, {"post": "* No experience needed, applicant will be trained * Paid in memes and pup pics * Must work weekends and holidays * Must be fluent in sarcasm * Must come in early and stay late * Benefits include being my bff and thats about the best benefit ever.

Apologies for any rambling. I've recently gotten back together with my ex boyfriend from over a year ago after only being back in each other's lives for about a month. He's already told me he loves me on these accounts: 1. When I was heavily intoxicated 2 weeks after we reconnected 2. When I was hungover sleeping on the couch the morning after a big fight about 2 weeks after the first account I thought I was happy to be back together with him but after the last time he spent the weekend with me at my college apartment, things have not been the same. It feels like we're in two different places in our lives. I'm a student who always has online work to do, trying to be as independent as I can be, while trying to keep my mental and physical health in line. He's a college dropout who has never lived on his own with a decent paying job, but spends it all on smoking weed. There's been a few incidents where I feel he doesn't respect me, my feelings, or anyone else's for that matter. Last time he visited me, I spent 2 whole(and extremely frustrating) hours in the kitchen preparing a dinner that he had been begging me to make, while he was asleep in my bed. When he woke up and came in the kitchen, he took one bite and said he wasn't hungry. That same night, we were at a friends apartment having some drinks and he spilled half a bottle of liquor onto the floor. My friend is extremely clean and neat so she politely asked him to clean it up. He took one paper towel and dabbed it on the floor, and then that was that. I told him he should really clean it up and he said that she shouldn't care about it. Not to mention, my whole apartment smells like a dispensary when he visits because he smokes inside. I've brought up the smell and he claims that if he doesn't smell it then it doesn't smell. I've explained his attitude before as \"going by his own set of rules wherever he goes, no matter how much he disrespects everyone else\". Ever since that weekend, I can't help but think that I deserve better. I feel like I'm babysitting when I'm with him. Every conversation, in person and in text, is about him and his life. I don't even talk about what's going on with me anymore because if I don't say it myself, he won't ask. His friends and family put me on this pedestal and say that I've been \"the only girl to ever treat him right\" and that I'm \"the only one that they've ever liked\" but that's a lot of pressure for one person to handle. It's like I can never mess up, even though I already have. I feel so ashamed about this part but I was very recently hanging out in a small group of people with one of my good friends who I met at school before quarantine. We had been flirting a bit all night and I was reminded of how much I really liked this friend. Like, really liked. I had never felt like that the whole time I've been back with my boyfriend and that was concerning to me. Since we were drinking, I told my friend that he could crash on my couch but he ended up staying in my bed. I was upfront and told him I had a boyfriend and he felt horrible that he was in this situation. He would never want to be that guy that helped a girl cheat, but he had nowhere else to stay or go. Nothing happened but cuddling between us but it was so refreshing to me. I was attracted to this guy, emotionally and physically. I can't say either of those things about my boyfriend. I won't even bother getting into his poor hygiene because that could be a whole rhetorical analysis essay. What I am desperately asking for advice on is this: if I feel so horrible with my boyfriend all the time, do I bother to stay and try to work things out or do I leave, like my gut is telling me to do? Not even keeping the good friend in mind because I felt like garbage about the relationship before the friend stayed the night with me. It's only been about a month of us even talking and 2 weeks of us being officially together. Everything just feels so rushed and he feels so clingy already. I'm not ready for him to want to spend every weekend alone with me and go on vacations together, like he's discussed even after I told him we need to slow things down. He claims to have changed but his actions don't back up his words. I do not want to be with someone who doesn't respect me or my space but I also don't want to feel like a bad person. This relationship is already something I'm unhappy with so if I don't get out now, will it just continue to fester and get worse?

I know we haven't talked in months, but it's true. You know, it's funny. You probably think I'm way over you right now. 4 months since the breakup, 2 since we had our last little text chat. We haven't seen each other in literal months. I've started university. I'm smarter. I have a new life, new inside jokes, new friends, and new traditions. Hell, I even look different. I started working out and I took off my braces. Even in Zoom university, I still get complimented for my looks. It makes me feel good, like I'm over you. But just for a short while, anyway. Despite what I show at the outset, I'm weak. Zoom university has been hard and it has been made harder by the time difference. Living nocturnally means I don't engage with my normal surroundings the same way I usually do. I still try to go to sleep at 5 AM in the morning imagining that I'm hugging you, and wake up in the middle disoriented by some romantic dream about you, or tormented by a nightmare that you've moved on. I still cry about you from time to time, and I still feel like I need to be held by you. Of course, I named this account something that you would recognize, because I'm a hypocrite. I'm not gonna shove my weakness in your face, but some part of me does want you to stumble onto this account and understand that I miss you so very much. If I can't text you to tell you how much I love you, and if I can't kiss you either, I guess sending a letter into cyberspace is the next best thing. Deep inside, I hope and dream that someday we can make it work. I know it can't happen today, or tomorrow, or in the next month or maybe even in the next year. But I hope that on some business (or leisure) trip that I'll inevitably take to the Big Apple, we can go out for coffee and dance in the rain as we've always wanted to but never been able to. I hope, that after a few hours I can kiss you and that we can reanimate the beautiful movie that was our love. The irony is that that was the biggest reason I needed to break up. We couldn't dance in the rain, we couldn't kiss, we couldn't sing love songs to each other on long road trips in the car, and though it was a hard decision to make, I decided that I needed that sort of love. While you will always have some part of my heart (and a big part, not a small one), I fear that I miss a version of you, a version of us, that never truly existed. I know that you want to talk, and I also know that it's probably too soon. I am still obviously in love with you and think about you a lot. But in these trying times, I know how helpful a conversation can be to both of us (assuming your sleep schedule has also been ruined, like mine has). I know how much I want to hear one more \"I love you, baby\", so I guess I'll end this little love letter with one to you.

Indoors: As much as I like being out, I also like to kick it back and watch a couple shows. Being the nerd I am I enjoy the DC/Marvel Shows that are out like Flash, Agents of Shield, Legends of tomorrow, Blacklist, Billions, Homeland. Gamer: Yes just like the most people on here I game lol. Im mostly into Nintendo but Im open to all games and trying it at least once. Foodie: I love to try different foods and dont restrict myself to just one thing. This is NYC after all! There is so much culture here and it would be a waste to not give it a try! Investing: In addition to working full time I do the stock market on the side. I'm still learning though and wouldn't mind sharing what I know. I don't mind texting in the beginning but I much prefer voice conversations. Open communication, honesty, and being reliable are important to me. If I say I'm going to do something, I'll do it. I'm very open about my sexual tastes/have no problems discussing it. Physical details: 64\" Short black hair, glasses, bearded, slender, White/Asian. Face/SFW body shots available via PM. Im not shy about posting them in public but would prefer them not be used on adult sites. I could go into detail on the sexual front but would prefer that for PM. Thats enough of this wall of text.

Im not going to be reaching out to hold a baby or coo at them anytime soon although I do find them to be cute. I grew up somewhat looking after the kids that came over our house and although it was fun, it was also exhausting. The problem is that now and then I see a cute family with toddlers around doing happy family stuff that I feel conflicted. Or see a toddler on the parents shoulder. I wonder at times if I meet the right person I would want to have kids but if thats also something my partner would want. And I think my max would be 1-2. Even thinking about kids right now is giving me some anxiety I also have this fear that I shouldnt date until Im in my late 30s because I dont know if my CF partner would change his mind one day and wants a kid or if my mind changes.

This is actually my first post on reddit, but I'm really curious about this game from my childhood and I want to know what it is. I've tried googling the gyst of it and I cant find anything. So I was around maybe 7-9 years old (so around 2004-2006) when my brother first bought this ps2 game. It was a turn base rpg with sprites/3D sprites that you would run around until it was the fighting turn instead of something high tech looking like FF12. You start out as a guy wandering around. You find a girl passed out on the ground and you wake her up and she joins you (I don't think I paid a ton of attention to story plot because I was young and just wanted to play the game for the hell of it) Shes wearing a really modest dress and I think her hair was like a hot pink or maroon look and she looked innocent when she would talk. You eventually get to a church with this girl and something happens like an earth quake or something super big happens and suddenly she passes out and a succubus/demon appears. I think it was supposed to be her other self or maybe she was possessed. The succubus had long pink hair in something like pigtails and she had black wings and looked like she was floating. She was the same look as the girl, just much more evil or something. My memory jumps a bit and you arrive at a cave and it's almost like a dungeon. You get to play as either the succubus or the girl and that's about where I stopped. I remember playing over the game and would stop when I would get there, so I dont know if it would suddenly get hard and I couldn't get past a boss or something else. I think I remember the case being a pink with dark purple and I think the succubus was on the front of it. It had a manual that showed all the characters and I had such a crush on the succubus that I ended up tearing it out and keeping it hidden so I could look at it a bunch. I dont know where the picture is but I've always wondered what that game was. This all the information I really have for it, so sorry if it's not a ton of information.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "Classes start tomorrow but my canvas page is empty. Im enrolled in two classes I checked everything what should I do?", "label": "0"}, {"post": "Okay, I wanna go over the hypocrisy of it all, and why it is that people still make excuses for this behavior that has been going on for years. 1. The mental health cop out. What frustrates me is that, we ALL have mental health issues. We ALL deal with having to work hard despite it. Shane uses his mental health issues as a cop out every single time he wants to sit in his house and not face reality. Every time. This isnt new. After every video he posts, he talks about needing a mental health break. After every time he is criticized. After every time he has to edit material. Its always mental health break. Depression. Anxiety. Etc. There are CHILDREN who deal with depression and anxiety and more, and they still go to school each day and they dont get a break. There are adults who work 8+ hours, sometimes 6 days a week, sometimes overnight, who dont get a break. Im one of them! We all work through our mental health issues. We all know that its not okay to use your mental health as a cop-out for poor behavior. So why do you excuse it with Shane? Why do you baby him? Youre playing into his game and youre enabling his actions exactly the way he wants you to enable him. You fall into his trap, and you let him off the hook over and over and over again and itll continue to happen until he truly burns out. . 2. He claims mental health issues, yet again. We have James, who Shane and J* and Tati drove nearly to suicide. Did James get a break from those mental health issues he was dealt? Did they give him that? ABSOLUTELY not. Are they letting him off the hook now? Absolutely not. Are they still trying to drag his name through the mud and tear him down, as we saw with Shanes statement? Absolutely they are. James was barely a legal adult. These people are 12+ years his senior, in their THIRTIES. They bullied someone barely out of adolescence unto the brink of suicide, and show NO remorse. Shane defended J* and glorified their actions with excuses such as James needed to be humbled. Disgusting. From 30 year olds? Disgusting. But Shane is sensitive, and deserves a mental health break, so he says. You guys are really going to allow that? Again? Again??? 3. When James addressed his wrongdoings and shortcomings, he did it with GRACE and DIGNITY. He took full accountability for what he contributed, and gave the full story of his experience. The other 3 immediately shut up, until now. We have J* still claiming James is a predator, with no proof. We have Shane, who has never even been able to give a genuine, wholehearted, Im sorry. 4. Shane and J* and Tati are to blame for the bullying that harmed James. They caused it. They perpetuated it. They encouraged it. They targeted him with the full intention of harming him in whatever way came about. And yet, in his statement, Shane did NOT apologize. Instead he turned to us, the audience, and blamed US, the internet, for bullying James and taking it too far. Youve got to be kidding me. How are some of you guys not absolutely outraged that he would do this? YOU watch his videos. YOU give him your money. YOU buy his pallet and his merch. And he blamed YOU and said YOU took it too far. That, to me, is one of the most disgusting things I have ever read from an influencer. Absolutely outrageous and demeaning and a vicious thing to say to your audience. How atrocious of Shane to shift the blame for his actions onto the people that support him the most. I cant even continue with this. You get it. 5. Lastly, he called J* a two faced, narcissistic, fake, drama-inducing, terrible person, amongst other beauty gurus. Right? Then immediately said I accept him and love him for all that he is, but the rest of the beauty gurus such as James can rot, basically. He told YOU, his audience, that you shouldnt set expectations for J* to be a good person. That YOU shouldnt hold J* accountable because then you wouldnt have entertainment. He told YOU, leave J* alone and let him continue to harm people because hes Jefree fucking star!!! what did you expect?! Some of you guys are really going to allow this manipulation once again. This blatant, irresponsible, intentional manipulation. He looked to you, the audience, and said dont crucify J* and I for our actions - dont set expectations for us to be GOOD people! But you guys took the James harassment too far. I believe he mentioned something about missing the part where J* devoted his life to christ or some absolute garbage like that. Are we supposed to bring that argument into all walks of life? A cop harms someone of color. Are we supposed to say well what did we expect?! Its a fucking cop!!! We shouldnt EXPECT them to be good people! We shouldnt hold them accountable! Of course not. Of COURSE not. But thats the argument, isnt it? So why is it excusable with J*, but not with other abusive people committing crimes? Whats the difference? How dare he be this hypocritical, once again, and some of you are going to let him off the hook. Again. Again. I seriously cant believe it. He looked us in the face and said that he and J* dont owe us anything, and definitely not maturity, responsibility, or moral goodness. He spent a whole 4 pages of notes continuing to spout out that somehow, 19 year old James Charles deserved this because he was getting too cocky in his own rewarding career path. But Shane said that we, the audience, should look upon him and J* in good graces for doing the same exact thing. How can you guys excuse this again? Dont tell me a 30+ year old cant handle the depression and anxiety that comes with messing up and being WRONG. Everyone deals with this. Every single person deals with being wrong sometimes, and making mistakes, and having to own up to them. Do not baby this grown man anymore. You fall into his trap every single time he spouts out this same nonsense, and thats why he continues to do it. Its his scapegoat routine. You as an audience deserve better. And what do you think is going to happen when J* turns on Shane, too? I suspect thats coming in the next year or so. J* burns every bridge and Shane isnt safe forever.", "label": "0"}, {"post": "I hope this is allowed here. I have a 2015 quadcore imac that has been struggling with StreamLabs.

Each week we'll be discussing another album (going chronologically from Warm Jets). This week we'll be discussing my personal favorite of Eno's: [BEFORE AND AFTER SCIENCE]( Let's take a look at the wiki: &gt;Before and After Science is the fifth studio album by British musician Brian Eno. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it was originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the UK and by US Island soon after. Guest musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany helped with the album, including members of Roxy Music, Free, Fairport Convention, Can and Cluster. Over one hundred tracks were written with only ten making the album's final cut. The musical styles of the album range from energetic and jagged to more languid and pastoral. &gt;The album marks Eno's last foray into rock music as a solo artist, with all following albums showcasing more of Eno's avant-garde and ambient music, which was hinted at on the second half of Before and After Science. The album was Eno's second to chart in the United States. The song \"King's Lead Hat\", the title of which is an anagram for Talking Heads, was remixed and released as a single, although it didn't chart in the United Kingdom. Critical response to the album has remained positive, with several critics calling it one of Eno's best works. ***DISCUSS***", "label": "0"}, {"post": "Just to preface, I havent seen my employees for 3 months so Im just spitballing on what Im thinking after watching some random vid on narcissism.

She deals massive damage, gets launched pretty late, is hard to combo, kills very early, runs quickly and is almost impossible to hit in this, hits very fast, has an incredible final smash, and has one of the best recoveries in the game. So that is why I believe that she deserves a great, full out nerf. Reason #1 - lightning fast attaks. Inkling has ultra fast hard hitting neutrals easily performed out of shield or dashes. These make a great close range attack. These are too fast, have far too large a hitbox and deal way too much damage. Reason #2 - a stellar recovery. As stated above, inkling has an incredible recovery which not only has a huge starting hitbox but also gains tremendous hight. This also coats the enemy in ink, more on that later, if it hits at any point. Reason #3 - ink bombs. Oh ink bombs, how utterly broken are you? They are practically etherial until they explode. Nothing can stop these things wrath. They will be spammed out so much that you just cannot approach the blasted squid. Did I mention they are almost etherial? Nothing can interact with them/desroy them. They also cover you in so much ink, way too much. Thankfully they can be slid under but not every character has that option. Reason #4 - the dammed ink itself. The ink is dumb and stupid and bad. It coats you so quickly and takes so long to vanish. The ink causes you to take more damage more easily but it appears way too quickly and is just no fun to deal with.

That includes gore, violence, or other rather adult themes that will appear further in the story. No dragon passionate hugging tho. For the first part click: [here]( For the previous part click: [here]( Long after the blue dragoness disappeared in the sea, the NightWing still watched the calm waves mournfully. He shed a tear, as he always did when his wife couldnt understand how much he missed her. How much he was afraid of the real possibility of her death. How much he hated all those scornful looks of the SeaWings. How much he wanted to leave the Sea Kingdom when he was alone with his daughter there. *Does she still love me? Would she even care if I disappeared?* Silentskies? voice from the darkness called. NightWing jumped, seeing the dark shape in the far corner of the balcony. He opened his mouth to call the guards, but then the voice added quickly. Its me. NightWing swiftly approached the source of the familiar voice, and set the nearest brazier on fire. He gasped in surprise, seeing the flame revealing shapes known to him. Dragon in front of him had beautiful, shiny black scales, and purple eyes that looked like they contained the starry night sky within. S-sister? He began, and brushed her wings with his. I thought you died in the eruption! What are you doing here? How have you been lately? That is not important, she interrupted. What matters now is that our queen finally took an interest in the SandWing war. I dont know why, but she seeks to prolong it. She sent me and others, because of her concern about your wife. And her regiment. Especially about their possible impact on the war. Wh-what do you mean? he asked, but dots in his mind already started connecting. If your SeaWing will create too much of an impact in this conflict, she... Starsight stated, with a troubled look on her face. Will have to disappear. And You work as an assassin.... Silentskies began, as the horrible truth hit him. He grabbed her talons with his. No! Please Starsight, you cant do this to her!!! I know, and thats why I came here, she responded, while her brother visibly calmed down and let go of her talons. She needs to abandon her war, or she would have to face the risk of being assasinated. Talk her out of it or something. She is your wife after all. That wouldnt work, believe me, Silentskies said bitterly. If it ever did, we would be both looking after our daughter, and enjoying each others presence every day. Starsight raised her brows, looking directly at her brother. He frowned at her and shook his head. *Do you think that convincing a SeaWing princess to do something differently is easy!?* Aaanyway, from the intel I received, she wont be an easy target to kidnap or poison, Starsight pointed out, reaching for notes in the pouch hanging from her neck. She put them in the light of the brazier and started reading. Employs food tasters, loyal guards, nearly always on high alert. Hmmmm And we havent even mentioned the entire unit of elite soldiers under her command. Maybe she will be safe... NightWing looked hopefully over his sisters shoulder at her notes, while she shook her head. Unlikely. Sooner or later the assassins will discover some weakness in her defenses, which will be exploited. she remarked. Hmmm Is she loving her daughter? What do you mean? NightWing demanded. If something bad wouldve happened to her, would Deluge return? Starsight asked him, looking into his eyes intensively. *I wish I wouldve known that. She always explains that she does all of this to me, her and the entire Sea Kingdom. When I proposed her escaping with our Sapphire, she refused angrily. She always enjoyed the war and the tactics involved. Possibly too much. But what if she loves war more than her own family and only uses the altruistic reasons as an excuse? No. It cant be true.* Of course! Silentskies exclaimed, after a moment of hesitation. At least I think. But I wont let you harm Sapphire. Why would you ask me about such things!? Oh, its nothing just throwing some ideas, Starsight said, but gave him a very odd glance, like she got her own answers. Silentskies looked at his sister and finally noticed how scrawny she was. *Woah, if even royal officials are starving, the situation in Night Kingdom must be truly desperate...* Although her underbelly was visibly swollen compared to the rest of her body, like she was But no, when Deluge had eggs, it wasnt visible at all, however she was not underfed like Starsight though... Could you possibly take care of one more dragonet? She asked shyly, noticing where he was looking. Yes, Im carrying an egg. I managed to keep it a secret, despite it being planned. Also I dont want my dragonet to live in this cursed volcano, where I would have to train it to become an- WOAH, yes I can do that, but how did this happen? Silentskies interrupted, surprised. Ive always thought you never wanted to start a family. Starsight sighed with sadness, and sat down on the cold marble floor. Dragoness raised her head to look at Silentskies. Thats because I never did. I was just very good at eliminating the queen's enemies quietly. She even decided that I should have an apprentice, she revealed, with her voice trembling, and a tear running down her face. Silentskies gently embraced her with his wing. Ive had a private audience with her, in one of her own rooms in the palace. She gave me a rather long speech about how mothers care about their own dragonets And listed the benefits of how good those apprentices always turned out to be, if they were related closely to their masters She She didnt leave me a choice... She groaned and broke into tears, nestling her head on her brothers shoulder. Silentskies eyes widened in horror. *THREE MOONS!!! Its.. Its HORRIBLE!!! If I was back in the Night Kingdom, I wouldve known that before it happened The queen surely had the best interest of the Kingdom in mind, like she always does, but NO!! This is just atrocious, sick and inexcusable!! I could've prevented that, and warned Starsight My poor, little sister If I ever see the queen again, I will kill her with my own claws!* Listen, Starsight. You cant come back to the Night Kingdom, if such things happen there, do you understand? he spoke with a firm voice to his sobbing sibling. And you cant follow Deluge in this state. Any travel would be dangerous both to you, and your egg. You are staying here with me. I- I cant stay here. If I disobey the order or leave, they will kill me. Unlike you, once a lowly spy, Im the royal assassin, she responded, with her voice cracking. They will send dragons after me and you, for helping the traitor. I cant put you in such danger. *Sapphire might get in danger as well because of it Why did such a hard decision just appear out of nowhere? Talons and tails, SHE IS MY SISTER, WHO CAME TO ME FOR HELP!! I I just cant turn her down...* I will protect you, little sister, Silentskies stated, hugging Starsight lovingly. I will double the guards on behalf of my wife, I wont let the NightWings harm you again. Dragoness returned the hug, and embraced his neck with her front legs. SHRIMP!!! He called, and soon after when a young orange SeaWing servant, adorned with a golden necklace, appeared in the balcony door, tilting her head in curiosity at the sight of the unfamiliar NightWing in Silentskies grasp, just as he stated: This dragon is my sister. She is exhausted and hungry, after her long journey. Prepare the guest room for her and also bring the most nutritious food you can think of to her chamber. Ummm Yes, sir! she responded and ran back to the manor, closing the doors with her tail. Come, I will show you your new room, its very close to mine, Silentskies said, covering his sister in his warm cloak. If you would ever need anything, summon the Shrimp, she will see to your needs. I Dont know what to say... Starsight replied, with her voice still trembling from emotion. You dont have to say anything, Starsight. I love you and I would do anything to keep you safe. He nudged her tail with his, and led her through the door to the exquisitely furnished main hall of the mansion. The warm light of golden lanterns nearly blinded Starsight, who froze in place, and opened her mouth, visibly baffled by the wealth of SeaWings. The great hall was much bigger than one might expect, judging by two, nearly invisible entrances that were dug into the mountainside. At least ten SeaWing, and SandWing guards were still patrolling the room, despite the late hour, but the reason for it was lying near the marble walls Treasure, spoils of war, gold, silver, gems were lying there, before splitting between the soldiers, with a rather small amount still carried back to the Deluges hoard. A huge number of the treasure that was present there wasnt of sea dragons origin. There were, among many other glittering valuables lying near the walls, diamond chandeliers, a huge, golden bust of some SkyWing hero, with angry ruby eyes, and several IceWing, SandWing and SkyWing banners, some of them even with claw marks or blood stains, hanging from the walls. It looks like you guys are truly profiting from this war, Starsight noted grimly, while eyeing the torn SandWing banner, which could be mistaken for the SkyWing one, because of the amount of solidified crimson liquid. Is Deluge some sort of trophy hoarder? Like every single royal dragon, Silentskies responded. And since the war itself is only waged on the MudWing, SkyWing and SandWing territory, SeaWings can only profit from it. Sea Kingdom was never raided, because nobody knows where their cities and hoards are located. Except certain NightWings of course. But what if Burns or Blazes alliance would get a hold of least one map of Sea Kingdom? she asked curiously. *Three moons...* Starsight, no! he quickly exclaimed, missing a step and staggering as a result. Countless SeaWings will die needlessly because of that. They dont really have any defensive measures to counter outside attacks, except their concealment. Theyre slower in the air than most of the dragon tribes, not able to breathe fire There are not a lot of allied SandWings,or MudWings as both are busy defending their own land That would be a slaughter Especially to the island settlements... Then what about Deluge? If I cant follow or indirectly cause the shift in SeaWing priorities, how do we protect her? dragoness asked, snorting out a small plume of fire with irritation. Dont worry, we will figure something out, something hopefully not involving deaths of the innocents, Silentskies responded, looking meaningfully at the various weapon and armor sketches, lying on the nearby table. *Throwing spears designed to stay in the dragon's flesh after the impact. Stolen from the Night Kingdom, and improved to a fletched variant with Deluge. Full-body plate armor. Similar story, but with the difference of adding the fireproof heat-insulating wool to prevent severe burns, following my own idea* Believe me, I have the experience in tinkering.

It was January 4th or 5th i believe and my mom and her boyfriend decided to take us to a park ( Chesapeake public park/fun forest ). This park is made of wood and has a little bit of history too as it is very well known in the area. The park had been previously burnt down as a terrorist act, after a lot of complaints and suggestions later, it way rebuilt. Ok on to my experience. We arrived at this park at sometime around roughly 4:45, the sun was already going down keep in mind. Me and my friend already had bad vibes about this park, the trees were huge and it was creepy in general. Even though it was creepy, M and F loved scary stuff and didnt have a story to tell so might as well stay. We studied the place a bit and started hearing things. We were walking towards the aquatic figures when i thought i salsomething zoom past us. I convinced myself that it was my imagination but realized it wasn't when i looked over to see F in shock. We noped the heck out of there screaming like teapots. M: \"it was probably just a bird\" F: \" did you see it's size! It was too fast to be a bird!\" M: \" dangit you're right!\" We kept exploring and started seeing shadows. Eventually we convinced the P to leave. As we waited in the car as they smoked a cigarette i thought it would be smart to take a photo. I send the photo to my friend because at that point i still had the wrong prescription glasses and wouldn't be able to spot anything. Sure enough he checks it out and F: \"what the heck is that?!\" M: \"what?\" F: *points to spot on his screen* M: \"omg what the heck\" Pretty much the ride home was us freaking out. In the photo my friend spotted a cloud like black figure with glowing red eyes in front of our car. We have been investigating ever since, trying to find something similar, and creating theorys. My friend has also posted about this. Please share similar stories or tell me where i can find one like this. Sorry about formatting issues im on mobile.

I do not smoke, drink, or use any drugs or medications at all aside from a daily vitamin. Let me first start by stating that I have always had very regular periods that lasted 3 days and have never been late. This time, I was a week and a half late for my period then finally began bleeding on November 24th and am still currently bleeding as we speak on day 31. The blood is bright red and seems to be fresh blood with a light to medium flow. There are a few clots throughout the day as well. I have not experienced any cramps or pain whatsoever this entire time. Initially when my period was late, I immediately thought I may be pregnant since I am not on birth control and never have been, and I am sexually active with my partner. I took around 6 pregnancy tests over the course of the week and a half that my period was late and they all came back negative. I have gained around 25 pounds within the last 6 months after moving in with my partner as comfort weight and am aware that it can possibly make your hormones fluctuate. Could this constant bleeding simply be due to the weight gain or is there a possibility that I had an early miscarriage and the levels of HCG in my body were not enough to detect on a pregnancy test and that is what is causing the bleeding? Are there any other possibilities at all for bleeding to occur this long? I do not currently have health insurance and I am afraid I can not afford numerous doctors visits. I do not feel sick at all and have no other symptoms whatsoever which is why I have not yet gone to the clinic. I would love to have a child in the future as well which is why this is so disheartening for me. If I am able to go to the doctor, what tests should I request be done?

I joined a siege for the first time yesterday and it was stressful, my god. The group I was in had a team member running Safi Armor pieces + Dual Blades and a Gunlancer who refused to take aggro whenever Safi went into murder mode. I was constantly having to heal the DB user and knock them out of stuns. No matter how often everyone used dust of life the dual blader carted 2 times. Luckily I ate for Safeguard. I \\[IG user\\] constantly got aggro and not once did the Gunlancer take it. I had to toss on a Temporal Mantle/Evasion Mantle to avoid getting hit. I don't have a shield so I had to go from evading to attacking when ever Safi took it's eyes off me for a millisecond. Safi finally escapes on the 3rd level which was fine. Suddenly, the Gunlancer decides to take aggro when we get to the 3rd level (2nd hunting round), didn't lure Safi to any gas spots and carted even after we spammed dust of life. The Dual Blader died yet again, but I was ready....I had eaten for Safeguard beforehand so we had 2 carts left at least. Once I got aggro again and quickly lured Safi to the gas spots. We finally killed Safi, but my god. I do not want to do it again. I was just baby sitting the entire time + dealing damage. I know teamwork is involved but it drives me nuts when teammates don't try to heal themselves or use risky weapons/armor. I feel if I got into the Safi'Jiiva sieges sooner I wouldn't have to deal with so many people using an armor set that chips away at their health. Also I dislike how another player has the chance to screw up the hunt. Not by carting, but by dropping rocks when Safi is no where near them or not luring Safi towards the gas spots.

The East Vs. West War had taken a turn for the worst. Lotd, FoE, SOV, abandoned the northern front, leaving Ming against overwhelming Odds outnumbered 4 to 1. Meanwhile, Lianyun had been completely overrun by the TempestWolves coalition along with their horde. OrderOfEmbers and RnG were all but completely destroyed. As Liege of \"OOE\" I was given a difficult decision to make. What did I do? I contacted my ally Wage, Leader of RNG, and together we agreed to merge into Ming and make our final stand against our massive amounts of enemies. Ming at the time had their own laundry list of issues including active players, reputation, etc.. When OOE &amp; RNG came, we rallied. We rallied 75 players against the onslaught and defended Mingyang. From there, We went on to push to the Spartan Legion Horde and the West, back into the depths from which they came. With this great victory over the West, Ming was reborn. Ming went on to conquer all of Maoyang and explore parts of Lianyun. Our Plunder was glorious, our morale high, and our ego's boosted. During this time life was great, the discord was poppin all the time, everyone was cool no real drama. Unfortunately for us, Mings old reputation lingered. Although we were a reformed house with essentially a completely new player base, we were still seen as the Antichrist and the true enemies of the NA server. With Maoyang conquered and our lands numerous, Ming turned to an alliance worthy of battling us. Ming, TempestWolves, &amp; Homegrown VS. Chaos, LatinWarriors, &amp; Blackshirts. Unfortunately for Ming, this war would take a turn for the worst. The war initially started off good with both of our allies linked with us fighting the Chaos onslaught and holding the line. With the Release of Archage, TempestWolves Gaming community decided to redirect their interests away from the game, and with them leaving, HomeGrown decided to run from the hills to Ostaria Leaving Us in a 3v1. With our allies gone and no one willing to stand up against The Chaos Army, we were simply outnumbered. Our lands slowly but surely fell. And with that, our precious home Mingyang. As Seneschal I did my best to rally our playerbase and keep morale high, those that were there, were there for the friendships they made and the good times they had. Those that were hungry for land left. Ming eventually found new allies, but alas, they were no match for the Chaos Armies, and by the time they came, the YTA horde decided to jump in and make sure we were not on the map. As one of the Leaders of Ming, it was truly an honor to have played with some of the most talented people on the server. When the Death Squad showed up with our 15 stack in a city, we would obliterate everything. Nothing was more glorious then watching us all in unison demolish all in our way. Unfortunately for us, when it comes down to TW, its not about skill or coordination, it comes down to the numbers. When you have 30 elite players vs 150+, there's not much you can do. Yes, we will conquer the city and defeat them, but when the timer runs out, they will just keep feeding players in until we are all killed. The friends I made along the way, made this game truly a good time for me. I'm sorry I couldn't do more to save Ming. Although most of you have gone your separate ways in game, you will always have my respect. I appreciate you all for staying with Ming as long as you did.

Growing up I always had an excellent relationship with my parents. We would do everything together and I always felt loved and supported by them. Throughout my life I have always had perfectionist tendencies and wanted to please my parents. Despite going through school with a 3.9 gpa, winning awards for my competitive dancing, and being very involved in community activities, I still always felt like I was going to disappoint my parents. Fast forward 20 some years- I came out to my parents as being queer and everything changed. When I came out to my parents I was a sophomore in college and their reaction wasn't great but it was ok. For them they believed my sexuality was more of a phase and would eventually fade away. I had so much anxiety surronding my own sexuality, and my parents have always been nonconfrontational, so we didn't talk about my queerness for years. It was the biggest elephant in the room at every family occasion. My anxiety rose through the roof and I felt that I was keeping things from them and living a very fragmented life. For the first time in my life, I really felt like a huge disappointment to my parents. Fast forward a little more, about 5 months ago I met my current girlfriend. She's great and I decided I wanted to share more of my life with her with my family, my mom in particular. So, I began to tell my mom bits and pieces about our relationship- mostly that I am happy and some information about my gf. My mom was always short in her replies (if she did reply) and was never engaged in the conversation whatsoever. Oftentimes when I would reach out to my mom about my gf (which was super hard and vulnerable for me to do), she wouldn't even reply to me at all. That particularly hurt me and damaged our relationship very much. Every time I would tell my mom I'm traveling to go visit my gf (we are long-distance) she would blatantly not reply to me or even acknowledge that I reached out to her. I know I'm an adult and not obligated to tell her these things, but I was really hoping to be more honest with her and visible with my relationship. But, her non-responsiveness is really hurting me. I'm sad and anxious all the time. I feel like her love is completely conditional. She will talk to me when it's about anything else aside from my relationship. So basically I don't know what to do. Do I keep reaching out to my mom trying to be more honest- even if I just end up being hurt by her not responding? OR do I no longer communicate with her about my partner and feel the guilt of withholding the truth from her? I feel like its a lose-lose situation.

So basically after I asked on this Sub Reddit how the revised Mental Heath Act 2017 protects the rights of adults against their human rights being violated. Everyone on this Sub Reddit who could went above and beyond to help me on explaining to me how it works. And after that I contacted a Human Rights Lawyer through Google in my city and he claimed that he knew all about this act and helped cases like mine and would help me. And he was the ONLY lawyer in my city that google could find who takes cases like mine. And yesterday I had my second appointment with him. And unfortunately at the end of the second appointment I was basically given A Flat Out NO We Cannot Help You In This Situation. BECAUSE: Everyone on this forum did read the Mental Health Act 2017 and explain it to me. BUT: NO ONE KNEW IF IT WAS IMPLEMENTED YET OR NOT. Bc everyone was basically just talking through theoretical knowledge only. And it turns out that though this law was passed in 2017. It is still not implemented as of yet. And it turns out that even if I draft an Advance Directive and Appoint a Nominee. They are of no use to me until the Authorities that themselves that are supposed to give them meaning Do Not Yet Exist. Basically since the revision of this Act. The government has now made it a law that Every State is to establish a State Mental Health Authority. Firstly. Secondly this State Mental Health Authority is to then establish State Metal Health Boards in each and every District of that State. And as of now. Majority of the States apart form literally less than the count of fingers on a hand have even established State Mental Health Authorities. And State Mental Health Boards are not yet even heard of. Punjab, Haryana and Delhi and a few other states have got State Mental Health Authorities but no Boards. Chandigarh has got nothing. And my lawyer told me that until these authorities are established and they come into action I am basically a sitting duck. And the only thing that can help me is if I can make a Government Authorised Shrink to give me a clean chit that I am sound of mind and mentally fit. Although upon talking to my lawyers the feedback seemed to be like that was basically as good as finding a needle in haystack. And even generally I am curios that do any shrinks even ever give anyone a clean chit if ever? Also especially given my situation. I know that my family is labelling me mentally unfit only to get their hidden agendas out of me. And obviously with that you can see my problem is that I usually never know why I'm being harassed until it's too late and finding out about why whatever happened is not even any use to me or anyone. And the problem with explaining this to a shrink is that when I say that my family is labelling me as mentally unfit bc of hidden agendas. The shrink hears \"She is loony bc she has baseless fears\". So my tomorrows mission is to find myself a shrink that can give me a pass. And I have no idea what I can do that is in my capacity to make it possible. And what ever else is there that my lawyer may have missed out on in this act that may be able to save my hide in this hour of need if anyone could help.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "So I got commissioned to make a logo for a band, and I basically have no idea how to design logos.

I pulled over and looked at them, didnt see anything unusual. Turned off the car, restarted the car, again, they moved very slowly and stopped. Desperate because I was on the side of a very busy, very fast highway with zero mechanic skills, I turned it on and off again and tried again.

From a very young age, girls are informed by the world around them that being pretty is a kind of power, and can lead to success; we see women who are lauded for their beauty all over TV, in movies and magazines, and in our own communities. While being ugly, well... it sucks. While the connection between beauty and success is problematic in its own rightall women have more to offer than just our bodiesthis screwed-up system is the one we actually live in, and its made exponentially harder when the vast majority of women who are praised for their beauty dont look anything like you. I could count on one hand the number of beautiful black women I saw on TV when I was a young girl, and when it came to kids shows, that number dropped to one: Meagan Good on Cousin Skeeter, a minor Nickelodeon show most of my peers dont even remember. I dreamed that Id be half as gorgeous as she when I grew up. Beyond this one actress, there were virtually no other black women to admire on child-friendly TV. While my friends could base their aesthetic on favorite celebrities, determining whether they wanted to be a Jennifer or a Courtney, Britney or Christina, Demi or MileyI was stuck. Being pretty and being black felt mutually exclusive. This lack of representation caused my 13-year-old self constant confusion and self-doubt. I know I wasnt the only adolescent black girl to look in the mirror and think: How do I feel pretty when pretty doesnt look like me? When there are very, very few people on television who look like you, its easy to believeespecially as a teenthat its because youre not worth representing. Beauty may be in the eye of the beholder, but when people arent choosing to behold anyone who looks remotely like you, youre bound to start asking why. When we did occasionally receive representation, the characters were awfully cliched; the few times a beautiful black girl was introduced on the shows I watched, she was inevitably depicted as an over-the-top urban sidekick. Whether I was watching Fairly Oddparents or Thats So Raven, the black characters were hardly multidimensional. By the time I was in college, TV had become ever-so-slightly more diverse. Glee was arguably primetimes most obvious effort at inclusivity to date, and I fell in love with the shows humorous and often progressive plotlines. However, while there was a black protagonist named Mercedes (shout-out to the fabulous Amber P. Riley), I still couldnt relate. Sure, Mercedes was rather straightlaced; her father was a dentist, and she was a smart high schooler, but her character was usually assigned the most tired storylines. Mercedes was frequently depicted as the overweight, over-agitated, loud, obnoxious black woman, a trope thats so played out. Pair that with her inability to keep a manmuch less the white guy she truly fell forand my eyes were rolling all the way to the back of my head. Things havent changed much since. If you ask someone to name a beautiful black woman (yeah, Ive asked), their response is usually Beyonc, Nicki Minaj, or sometimes \"that black girl from Scandal,\" a.k.a. Kerry Washington. Although Im sure most millennials could name at least dozens of blonde, brunette, and redheaded white actresses (hell, probably dozens of each), most of my peers would be hard-pressed to name 10 black actresses much less 10 they consider beautiful. I am tired of Beyonc being the token woman of color when there are so many other beautiful black voices and faces that deserve to be amplified. I am tired of feeling like my beauty and the beauty of those who look like me can only shine on an urban series like Empire or Power. And I am tired of black women being portrayed as one-dimensional, for that matter. I am tired of being seen as threatening, \"ghetto,\" and just too much. I am tired of hearing the words \"youre pretty for a black girl.\" That sentence has been said to me on more than one (or two or seven) occasions, and it stings like rubbing alcohol in a fresh wound. And in a way, it is exactly like that: a constant reminder that the world would love me if I was disinfected and sterilized of the blackness they think Im plagued with. I have spent a lot of time wondering if I am overreacting to all of this. Its easy to suggest that self-confidence is an internal characteristic we should nurture independent of others opinions. But unfortunately, changing how we think and feel isn't so simple. From billboards to our local prom queens, young people are inundated with image after image of beautiful women who are celebrated exclusively for their beauty. And many of the jobs that confer status and glamour, and are depicted as being especially desirablebeing a Hollywood actress, for instanceare overwhelmingly populated by white people. What conclusions would anyone draw here? So when my 6-year-old sister asks me why there arent girls who look like her on TV, I know that no, Im not overreacting. I dont want this cycle to keep repeating; I dont want my sister to grow up flipping through Teen Vogue and wondering where all the girls with brown skin are. We need to do a better job at expecting and demanding their inclusion. We need to stop focusing only on Jennifer Lawrence and Bella Thorne and Kendall Jenner, and talk more about Yara Shahidi and Zendaya and Amandla Stenberg. There are so many brown and black girls who are not only talented, but also stunningly gorgeous. It took a long time for me to look in the mirror and see myself as pretty. I may have been blessed with cheekbones I dont need to contour, but for years, my sense of my own beauty was masked by the insecurity I felt as I developed hips and griped about the texture of my hair. Self-love is an uphill battle for all of us, but its downright treacherous when you feel you simply cant be beautiful. When I was 13, all I wanted was thin hair that fell freely down my back and skin that was seven shades lighter. A decade later, I want my little sister to live in a culture that wont inhibit her feeling beautiful for so long, and for pop culture that shows her that yes, brown girls are pretty too.

The attic used to be where the servants slept (in the days when middle class people could afford staff) with the house keeper/cook occupying the large room and the maid in the box room. All the rooms (except the kitchen and the box room) had (now un-used and boarded up) open fire places. Kate's mum and dad were in their early 60's and slightly old fashioned but very sweet. I was a regular guest at Kate's house when we were younger, on 2 occasions there had been spooky happenings during my visits. On this, the third occasion, I was about to leave (my dad was waiting in the kitchen for me), I went upstairs to say 'bye to Kate's mum Pam (who was in the office next door to her bedroom) as I reached the top of the stairs, I saw her coming down the attic stairs (opposite her bedroom) and in through her bedroom door, I followed her in to see her knelt down in front of the fire place, I assumed she must have dropped something and was looking for it so I went round the bed to help her look. I was about to get down on the floor when the bedroom door opened... I turned to see Pam coming into the room then looked back down to see NOBODY kneeling on the floor.

We are a friendly 18+ FC who just formed earlier this month on Ultros in preparation for Shadowbringers. Both our founders are knowledgeable in multiple areas of the game, been long time fans of the entire series, and have had years of overall leadership and raid leading experience across multiple MMO's. You're in good hands here. We have discord set up and organized, an FC house in Mist Ward 18, Plot 38 with rank 7 perks, moving on to rank 8 quickly (As quick as one person can do of course lol). Our guild is based off of the legendary Highwind airship from FFVII and thus all our ranks are named after the most iconic airships throughout the series. Our tag is the acronym for DRINK YOUR GODDAMN TEA (DYGT), an epic quote from Cid Highwind himself! So let me be clear on what we want to achieve. We're new and willing to teach and learn as we go along through the next expansion with hopes of having one to two static savage raid teams in the least (Potentially more if we get enough interest and start becoming large). We will need raid leaders and officers to help us along this journey. Overall, we're looking to be a hub and home for people. A community. A social, active FC for anyone to put down roots, not just raiders. We're looking to begin recruiting a tight knit group(s) of people, who love the game and are willing to follow our charter (in DISCORD which will be provided for you upon joining) for multiple positions, including that of Officers (upon review if you're found to be a good fit of course), and have aspirations for primarily savage raiding, primal and mount farming, Deep Dungeons, treasure maps, FC events where items and gil can be won while having a good time. We offer a home for the most adamant of crafters as well if that is your focus, and while we don't really RP, RP'ers are also welcome to make a home with us. While we only have a handful of people atm, we can make our dreams a reality with more dedicated members. Be brave and take the leap with us!

Jesus calls his last day the day he died which was followed by his \"resurrection\" John 6:39 And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, **but should raise it up again at the last day**. He also says we will also be raised up again at our last day..

John 12:48 He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same **shall judge him in the last day**. So living once and then being judged is not an argument against reincarnation. It is just describing how we our judged after each life. Now you can read 1 Corinthians 15 and it confirms reincarnation is biblical. It is actually a fact according to Rev 20 as well because evil souls are banned for an age.. 1000 years and can later return.. how do you think these evil souls will return? In ressurected heavenly bodies? No.. more like how we come to earth now.. through a mothers womb. Resurrection has always been reincarnation. Jesus also confirms this here.. 3 Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again. 24 Martha saith unto him, **I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day**. 25 **Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:** Jesus is our life and resurrection now... many will not get what this means .. read 1 Corinthians 15 it is time. He is our hope we will chance of another grain and ascend.. he is the opposite of our earthly imperfect life with hope to ascend above it. As all die in Adam so is is all reborn in Christ.

I am using ultimate guitars tabs apps chord library for where to find the chord and how to hold it because that is the most accessible database to me. Now the chord: So today is B dim chord. The dim chord is a chord for the seventh note in a major scale and has a 3 of the second note of the scale and a 5 on the fourth note. The 3 is a minor third and the 5 is a half step down or diminished. With the B dim chord it is used in the C major scale, so our 3 is D and our 5 is F. Now into the chord itself let's show the chord E:x A:x D:0(0)/D G:4(4)/B B:3(3)/D e:1(1)/F Format String:fret(finger)/note As you can see we have two 3s, a 1, and a 5 making a triad When I tried learning this chord this was the easiest variation for me to learn and a to throw it into use I tried imagining it as a D minor chord that was modified.

So I stopped trusting verbal communication of feelings. And she never got me help so I dont know if I actually officially had depression or not. But we had a lesson about disorders in psychology the other day and I recognized the symptoms in myself. What I cant tell people I pour into my writing. THIS is how I feel. THIS is real.

Im tired of people misinterpreting a cry for help for pretty writing so Im posting here, where people may actually understand. This isnt a pretty story, this is MY LIFE. Im just not straight out telling you because you wouldnt get it if I did. So here goes: Glass Coffin Sometimes I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. Not an old fashioned, vampire-type coffin, but a simple box, rectangular and just long enough to fit my body, a container made of delicate glass. I cant see the glass Im completely blind, not in darkness but in absolute black. I cant see anything, not the soil I know surrounds my prison, not my hands or fingers or body. But I can feel it smooth and cool under my fingers, it squeaks sometimes when I drag my hands across the surface and I can feel the smears of oil left behind. And I know if I struggle enough, I could get out. It's only glass after all. I could writhe in my prison until it cracks, until the blood of a thousand tiny scratches oozes out of my hands and arms and pools onto the floor of my cage. I could claw my way up with my bloody, dirt-caked fingernails until I find my way to the surface. But I don't. Sometimes, I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. It's constricting, too much, and I have to get out. The container is only wide enough that my arms, glued by my side, touch its walls. I can feel the ceiling brush my chest every time I breathe. My feet rest flat on the back wall; I can barely even bend my knees. My head touches the other wall, and the long tangle of my hair gently tickles my cheeks with every breath. And that's the worst part; not the hair but the way it itches. Itches are strange. They're addicting, like pain; and once you have one, you need to get rid of it. But unlike pain, itching is a part of everyday life which means you aren't used to resisting it. It's worse than pain; it consumes every thought. I reach up to scratch the itch on my right cheek, but I'm too slow. The width of my glass coffin isn't long enough for my arm and I have to bend it awkwardly so that my elbow rubs against the wall and my wrist is bent downward until I can reach up to scratch it. And it's strange; the pain of pressing my lower arm against the width of the box doesn't bother me at all. But once the itch is gone, I don't bother moving my arm back. Instead, I rest it on my chest. Sometimes, I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. I'm suffocating; it feels more like an esophagus than a coffin. I can feel the heat pouring off of me in waves. That just might be the worst part: the body heat. I'm sweating profusely and I can barely wiggle around to my stomach. My arms are pinned to my sides so I have to sort of belly flop back over, except the coffin isn't very tall so my butt hits the ceiling every time I flop back and when Im lying on my stomach, my face is smashed into the floor of the cage and then I really cant breathe. I feel the sweat dripping; on my forehead, into my eyes; on my back, making it itch, except I can't even reach my back with my hands; instead I have to rub it against the floor until it makes that annoying squeaky sound and the friction finally removes the itch. Sometimes I think I might drown in my own sweat. It's possible; I'm in a sealed glass container deep underground. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. I don't know if the physical torture is the worst part, or if it's the nauseating claustrophobia. Hunger is a living creature writhing in my belly; my throat feels like it has sand caked into it. Sometimes I scream, just to hear myself; the silence seems to slam down every time I stop thinking or making noises. I say my name over and over, trying to form the strange sounds and string them together. They sound wrong somehow; like they shouldn't matter. Why would my name matter if there's no one to hear it but myself? Language decays into incoherent noises, animal sounds, except they arent even that. Animals communicate and the movements I make with my throat and tongue arent a form of communication, they are meaningless absolute. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. Except, now I'm on the surface. I stare at the pure blue sky and the wispy, serene clouds. The grass lays flat, a too-bright green. My family is there; even my cousins. They're weeping and sobbing. Except...that isn't right. Can't they see I'm breathing? I try to call out to them but my throat doesn't work. Neither do my hands, when I try to bang on the glass, or my arms or my head. I can't even blink; I can't even turn to see their heart-broken faces. I just stare at the creamy blue sky. I try to scream, and I can hear the tiniest, most shrill sound build from my throat, but they don't stop sobbing. They never do. Sometimes I feel like I'm in a glass coffin. I'm naked; my body is exposed to every breathing thing around me. People are wandering around, serene. Strangers, all of them. They gaze at me like curious birds, heads cocked to one side. As if they don't know what I'm doing here in this strange container, but it doesn't really matter to them anyway. They walk in that absentminded way, hands clasped behind the back, head tilted slightly up, not a care in the world. I'm on display, I realize. If I could move, they would know I'm alive. I wiggle around in my box. It's on a simple wooden table; if I could move it to the edge, I would drop and it would shatter hopefully. The ground is spongy grass and smells of rich soil and clean stalks of grass. I don't know how I can smell it; perhaps it's the anticipation of breaking free that's feeding me new sensations. Finally the coffin slides to the edge. I'm rocking back and forth now, eager. Freedom is so close, I can feel it, a physical, airy sensation. I thrash in my prison, yelling, gasping because I can taste the fresh air on my tongue, gulp it down my throat. It must be sound proof glass because no one notices my voice, but it fuels me and invigorates me. I brace myself; I'm tipping over. One of the strangers looks over, startled. He calls over someone else and together, they gently push my coffin back onto the table, in the center now, so I could never use my momentum to push myself far enough. I bang my fists on the sides and flail back and forth and scream, trying to catch their eyes. They walk away.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "[The Ketchup Fountains of Equality ]( So this is a bit of a story, but its worth it. I went to eat dinner with my wife at Freddys. At this location, they have a ketchup station with three identical ketchup sauce dispensers. (I know it looks like two are jalapeo ketchups, but they are not... its just a labeling, the jalapeo ketchup is located elsewhere.) Anyway, when I was up getting something to drink, I saw this father and his two daughters. One was about eight, and the other was about five and wearing bright pink cowgirl boots. Well, Little Miss Pink Boots was directing her dad to pump the ketchup from one fountain into her ketchup cup, the ketchup from another fountain into another cup for her big sister, and ketchup from the third fountain into a third cup for her father. She also wanted them all pumped at the same time, so that everything would be fair. Well, the father tried to explain that simultaneous pumping was very difficult, and that it didnt matter what fountain the ketchup cane from, because it was all the same. Little Miss Pink Boots was having none of that. She very calmly and clearly explained that the fountain on the left was her fountain, the fountain in the middle was her big sisters fountain, and the fountain on the right was her dads fountain. On this, there was to be no compromise. Of this, she was 100% certain. Big sister just wanted to eat, and didnt care so long as she got ketchup. A line was starting to form, and dad was getting rather self-conscious. Therefore, he proposed to Little Miss Pink Boots that she discard the notion of simultaneous pumping in favor of her eye-balling the level of each ketchup cup as it was filled from each of the three fountains. After a moment of silent reflection, Little Miss Pink Boots decided that this was fair and equitable. So there he was, this father carefully pumping ketchup from three different fountains with Little Miss Pink Boots watching carefully. After it was determined that everyone had received an equal portion of their particular allotted ketchup, Little Miss Pink Boots nodded and acquiesced to them going to their table and eating. Little Miss Pink Boots never raised her voice and never threw a tantrum. She just plainly stated how things were going to be.

I realised with horror that I had been wasting hours of my week watching Netflix. I'd got addicted to it and hadn't even realised. I don't drink, smoke or take drugs so I don't see myself as a typical 'addict' type person but I've noticed that when it comes to Netflix and the internet I can get addicted and waste hours where I totally tune out/dissociate and then tune back into myself hours later feeling zoned out. I've decided this won't do. I'm not going to achieve my goals if I keep living like this. So this week I have to made two simple key changes: &amp;#x200B; Change 1: Drink only 2 cups of caffeinated drinks per day or one coffee since it makes me too alert at night; Change 2: Log out of Netflix and stop watching it completely for two weeks before reviewing. &amp;#x200B; I'm thinking that I might be shut down my Netflix completely until the winter, or maybe just never watch it again? The only things I can see myself missing would be Star Trek and Good Witch because these shows tend to make me feel positive, happy and motivated rather than trigger that numbed out zoned out addictive feeling. However, I don't think I'm able to just watch them without getting tempted to watch other less helpful shows too.

At first this seemed great and I just watched the odd film or odd episode of Star Trek but it really escalated over the past few months to watching entire seasons of multiple shows and I started to feel really ashamed about this which seemed to fuel my lack of motivation to work on my goals. It was also making me really tired as I was staying up really late watching Netflix most nights. &amp;#x200B; In the past I achieved quite a lot of things such as getting a degree, getting a difficult professional post grad qualification but I had a breakdown before I reached 30 from working 70 hours a week in an ill-suited career and had to stop working due to depression and panic attacks. Since then I've been in and out of work but have had real difficulties achieving my goal of working in my dream role. I think most of it is fear of having another breakdown from overwork and also fear of failing again. These fears have kept me trapped in a safe bubble which is helpful during recovery but I don't want to live like this forever, I want to work, be part of society again and prove to myself that I'm not incapable and I can do on earth what I feel I was put here to do. &amp;#x200B; I slept a lot better last night and the past few days I have felt more centred.

I brought up to my mom that I want to use my savings and work through the summer to afford my tuition, which is very affordable and always will be since I am attending college and not University, instead of accepting band funding.

This week, we've got the SO units, Raegen, Jiraiya, Lila, NG Jake, and Emperor Shera. Obligatory link spam: [Unit Rankings]( [Explanation of rating methodology]( [Damage comparison spreadsheet]( [Last week's thread]( ##Sophia Sophia's damage is extremely high, averaging about 2.3b over the first seven turns of the fight. Her asymptote damage of 2.592b is actually slightly higher than Kurasame's output (although it would take a fairly long fight for her to actually catch up to Kurasame's overall damage). She's also got three elements to choose from. Fire (CW frames) is her strongest option, but dark (CW frames) and earth (Quake frames) aren't bad either. She has doesn't really have MP problems, due to her MP restoration counter and 10% regen per turn, and can even use Convert Damage in a pinch to help refill. However, she doesn't burst anywhere near as hard as Kurasame, lacks a dark imperil, and cannot deal non-elemental damage. Still, she's a very strong and flexible unit overall, and we've rated her at 20.0. Her 6* is another story, sadly. Reminds me of Tiana, in that all of the moves that make Sophia great at 7* are absent from her 6* kit. The only real option she has is to dualcast a 2.2x Freeze frame move, which is a bad modifier for a not-so-great family. We've rated her 6* at 10.5, a full point below 6* Tiana. ##Fayt 7\\* Fayt isn't as good as Sophia, but he's still pretty solid. His damage output across the first 11 turns averages out to 1.84b, putting him about on par with Tifa. He's got four imbues to choose from, and imperils all of them with his LB. There are drawbacks, though. He's got a stacking modifier which takes a long time to build up, but he lacks the survivability of a unit like Sephiroth, increasing the risk that he'll die and lose his stacks. His imbues last for *twelve turns*, which makes it clunky to swap elements mid-fight because you pretty much have to dispel him. And in addition to modifier ramp up, he doesn't even have an imperil on the early turns until you can get his LB going (and 22-26 crystals with no fillrate can take at least a few turns). Nonetheless, strong damage, elemental flexibility, and AT frames is a recipe for success. We've rated him at 19.5. ##Rena 7\\* Rena was very, very close to being an amazingly powerful unit, but her inability to dualcast her DR frame move or her AoE reraise cooldown limit her potential. As a healer, she didn't really gain much of anything. The new reraise cooldown is nice (very similar to Rem's), but it doesn't heal, so you have to rely on the HoT from her LB on that turn, which may not be sufficient if your tank is getting trucked. And a cost of 40 on her LB is no joke, since you'd have to choose between gearing for LB fill and gearing for SPR so that the heal is strong enough to allow you to forego Curaja on that turn. But magic mitigation + regular mitigation + bard buffs + good heals is a potent combo. Rena feels like a weaker version of CG Nichol who happens to have Curaja, and that can be pretty great. For now, we've rated her at 19.0, alongside Rem. As an aside, discussions of her are still ongoing. I mentioned last week that [JP is apparently in the midst of a \"use two healers\" meta]( We don't yet have a good sense of how that meta will shake out, and it's not realistic to rate around something that we don't understand, but it's very likely that Rena will see a noticeable increase in rating once we begin to account for that, because another healer can easily cover up her shortcomings. ##Emperor Shera 7\\* Emperor Shera comes out of the gate with unbelievable damage output-- as in, I literally didn't believe his damage could possibly be this bad until I double checked it. Chaining with a dupe is so terrible that I didn't even bother to math it out. When paired with another DR unit, he's not much better, sitting at around 490m damage per turn on average, whether he uses an elemental weapon or uses his imbue. That doesn't *quite* make him the worst 7* chainer in the game, but he's close to it-- he only beats out Ramza, Rinoa, Citra, Popstar Katy, and Marquis de Leon. Even if you wanted that imbue, you'd be better off giving an elemental 1h weapon to your main chainer and then pairing up with someone who *didn't* have trash tier damage-- like, Orlandu + Hyoh is higher damage than eShera + Hyoh. And that's with full TDH! You can't even think of Emperor Shera as a good budget option for 10-mans where you can't bring dupes, because people who need budget options likely don't have two full sets of TDH (one for eShera, one for whatever TDH chainer he's being paired with). He's got some support skills in his kit, but for the most part, it's barely better than just giving someone Cradle of Horns or whatever, and I don't see anyone making much use of him in that way. But he's still a DR chainer, which leaves him with a bunch of solid partners. We've rated him at 16.0, which is on par with Delita. ##Nameless Gunner Jake 7\\* The less said about Jake's chaining, the better. Instead, we'll look at his finishing, which isn't amazing, but at least it doesn't make me want to weep tears of blood. Jake requires a few turns of setup, following which he'll burst for about 860m. This is slightly higher than Olive's LB, and he has four elements to choose from instead of being (mostly) locked into one. Unlike her, he cannot burst without setup, and he doesn't have the DEF/SPR breaks that she does (which can really ramp up your damage dealers if your breaker isn't already doing that)... but your breaker probably *is* already doing that, and FTKO strats are kind of a thing of the past these days. So, while the setup is disappointing, it's not crippling. We've rated him at 16.5, which is on par with Olive. ##Lila 7\\* There's two ways to build Lila. You can either build her for SPR, which is disappointing, or you can build her for ATK, which is even worse. The SPR build's average damage output hovers a bit below 900m throughout an entire fight, which is about on par with Onion Knight (read: not amazing). She can swap between two elements and will be disgustingly tanky against magic damage due to her high SPR, but she only has one chaining partner, AD Kain, and he's even worse than she is. We've rated her at 16.5, which is on par with Lightning. ##Jiraiya 7\\* More sadness here. Jiraiya requires a setup turn just to start chaining, and doesn't get a \"real\" chaining family until he uses his LB, which is likely to be four or five turns. Once you get past that point, his damage is kind of acceptable, at 925m, but when you average in the earlier turns, he's sitting closer to 800m across the first 13 turns. He's got three different elements he can swap between, which can be useful on some fights, and is part of three chaining families (DR, KG, and Octaslash), but the fact that he's not chaining with any of them until later in the fight is a massive downside. We've rated him at 16.5, alongside Lila. They deal comparable damage, and while Jiraiya has more/better partners, it takes too long to set him up. ##Raegen 7\\* Finally, a unit from this batch that's actually decent! Raegen's damage output is fairly similar to Hyoh's, he's got a bit of utility in the form of various elemental resistance buffs, and as a DW unit he doesn't really have MP problems. But his rotation is a bit of a mess. You're using DR frames, AT frames, *and* his LB, preventing him from being a good chaining partner for other units. And he imbues himself with both fire and ice at various points, so the damage drops a lot if the boss is immune to either one. Contrast that with someone like Hyoh, who can simply pick one of his two elemental options and not use the other if the boss is immune. Oh, and Raegen's imbues don't even have 100% uptime, which makes him less than ideal in terms of elemental flexibility. Still, while the downsides are there, they aren't massive, and his utility makes up for it. We've rated him at 19.0, alongside Hyoh. ##Closing Words Next week, we'll look at Auron (fantastic), Jecht (great), Pure Summoner Rydia (bad), Mediena (mediocre), AD Kain (garbage), MS Nichol (pretty good), and HT Lid (pretty good). I'd also like to take a moment to talk about chainer ratings. Now that all of the batches are out, I'm planning to go back and review a lot of the ratings. Over time, things can get messy, and it's useful to revisit and see if any units are rated higher or lower than they should be. In particular, I think that there's sort of a no-mans-land around 17.0-17.5 where we've kind of dumped a lot of units that maybe shouldn't be there. I wouldn't expect the top-end rankings to change much (if at all), but the mid-ranking chainers will probably get reshuffled at least somewhat. And after we've done that, we'll take a look at the 6* chainer ratings, and begin to adjust those based on whether or not they have 7* partners, and how good said partners are.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "IMGUR ALBUM: (includes reflective photo at the end) Price: $88 plus shipping Sizing: XS (smallest they offer and it's still huge ).

Obviously a bit late to the party but quite obsessed. So several things: 1. What was the plot point of Harts older daughter drawing graphic images of men and women having sex? And was it she or the other daughter who had one of her Barbie dolls in a compromising position in the middle of a gang-rape-about-to-happen, that Hart eyed on the floor as he left her room? I got the sense that she may have observed some kind of ritual or sexual abuse which made me question if perhaps Hart and his often creepy wife were involved in the forest rituals. It would explain, perhaps, her sexual promiscuity as a young girl and a teen. (I also found it interesting that Harts wife was reading REVIVING OPHELIA on the couch when he confronted him about his second affairand wasnt it symbolically incestuous when when Hart slept with the girl whom he had rescued from the hillbilly brothel?) 2. Why did the tall tattooed meth maker, just before he got his head blown off, say what he did to Rust? About recognizing him or expecting him or something? Or that he had dreamt of him? And why did the other guy say what he did about Rusts eyes when they were trying to strike a deal at the bar with Ginger? Did they sense a goodness in him that they knew was coming to fight the evil? (See best theory link about Rust being the second coming of Christits pretty amazing.) 3. Was Errol truly the devil incarnate or just a crazy cracker? Were the accents a symptom of his psychosis or that the devil might have different personas and languages within? Do you think Errols devil spirit went into another family member when he died? Were the Tuttles and their cult made eternal and prosperous through their sacrifices of young children or was it just an excuse for debauched pedophilia? Why did some children live and some not? 4. Why did the catatonic girl say what she said to Rust in the asylum? 5. What was the point of having that tape of the ritualistic sacrifices and images of young girls in the safe? Why even have them in ones possession? 6. And WTF about the green ears and the green-painted house? For writing that could be so philosophical and cosmic in consideration, and other deeper deductions, that just seemed lame and lazynot to mention far-fetched and obscure for Hart to be the seducer. 7. Was that Errols sister or mother in the house and was it me or did she take on the face of the dead Errol while slumped in front of the staircase after backup arrived? And where did she go? Did she perhaps take on the devil spirit from Errol after he was killed? Those are the hints I am pondering. As well as the brilliant Rust-as-Christ theory on another Reddit.

My father did not agree at all with this choice, but my mother followed her parent's advice anyway and it has cause some problems. Fast forward to now, they are planning on getting a divorce. I've overheard them talking and my mother wanted to try to work things out, but my father is adamant about splitting. I need some advice on spending more time with them and supporting them, especially since this is my last year here before I move away for college. Normally I don't spend that much time with them, but I'd like to change that. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure how long they've been married or their exact ages (I am sort of distant with them). I've tried improving by helping my dad with yard work more and helping my mom prepare her classroom for when winter break ends. Since I'm on break right now I've been able to help them more than normal. I also made sure to get each of them a thoughtful Xmas present. What else could I be doing though? One night when I came home about a week ago, I found my dad all sad and he said my mother was \"out\". He then called some lady on the phone and drunkenly talked to her about \"how he misses her\", and \"how he thinks about making love to her\", and weird stuff about living together (all of these were directed to the lady on the phone who was NOT my mother). This was also how I first learned my parents' relationship was \"done\". A couple days after this, my mom talked to me about how they're planning on getting a divorce and she asked me about my dad's conversation when she wasn't home. I lied and said I didn't hear what they were talking about, but when she asked if it was about weird stuff I said yes. I don't know if I should tell her everything I heard. I'm unsure if she knows about how my father feels about this lady since I heard him defending his phone call with stuff like \"we're just friends\" and \"what, i can't talk on the phone?\". Im also confused about my parents future living situations since my mother wants to move away. I don't really know where she'd live or if she makes enough to support herself (shes a middle school teacher while my father is a college professor). If my father continues to live in the same home I feel like he'd drink himself to death or something, he is a bad alcoholic. There is also way too much yard work for him to do himself if me and my mom leave. Im just worried about how things will work out and what I'm supposed to do. My parents have been going out to eat a lot recently so maybe thats a good sign, they still get along and are now saying \"I love you\", but they have big complaints about each other. I'd say I have a pretty good relationship with each of them, we now never argue at all, but should I be doing more for both of them? And how do I go about doing that? TLDR; Its my last year before college and I want to spend more time with my parents since they're going to get a divorce and live separately. Im not sure if my mom knows fully about an explicit conversation between my dad and another woman. I need help on spending more time with my parents or supporting them.

So I just started using a UniFi switch and have slowly started building out other pieces of hardware. Its kind of addictive.

I took all the eeros offline with the exception of 1 in order to compare coverage and throughput. The eero is currently acting as the router in this scenario. On the 5ghz network, the eero was consistently outperforming the NanoHD with every speed trial I conducted. I would have though the NanoHD would have either met or exceeded the eero. Now, I dont know if the fact that the eero is acting as the router may have something to do with it, or that I havent tweaked the NanoHD in the controller enough.

Some backstory, my boyfriend and I broke up in April, back together in May, (he broke up with me) for truly wack reasons. If interested (but no pressure to read all of this!) heres my prior post: It was a huge shock to me as he completely blindsided me with the break up. Pretended for MONTHS like nothing was wrong. After almost 3 years, needless to say I was extremely hurt. Towards the end of the relationship looking back he did start pulling away, and treating me poorly. I noticed him flirting with a female bartender at his weekend job. Since that had never happened before, I did not automatically assume it was because he wanted to dump me. I knew he was working very long hours at work, so I stupidly gave him the benefit of the doubt. My therapist says how he acted towards the end is the true definition of passive aggressive behavior. And if that is the kind of avoidant/ passive communication pattern he has, then to be grateful as he did me a favor. A big part of me did in fact feel like he did me a favor. There were other big issues. As he has some pretty hefty codependence issues with his ex-wife (they also have a 14 yr old), and he has allowed his alcoholic father to live with him in his apartment (he pulled his dad out of rehab because he felt bad for him). Initially he told his dad he can live there only if he A) doesnt drink, and B) at least finds a part time job. His dad has continued to drink, and there have been no consequences, and his dad has not applied himself to getting a job. Obviously the alcoholism is a huge part of that. My boyfriend refuses to see himself as an enabler rather just says its my dad what can I do? Being somebody who works in the social worker / therapy field, I know how off base that kind of thinking is. As my own therapist said, in terms of the break up, he did commit a form of betrayal. So rebuilding trust and comfort in the relationship has been challenging. He lost my trust certainly in the sense that I dont believe him anymore when he says hes okay or nothings wrong (even after hes clearly not). So getting to present day. My boyfriend has for the past year since he started this new job, gone out for beers with his male boss and his 1 other male colleague. So he says. Previously, there wasnt any point when he said hes getting a drink with the guys after work I thought otherwise. Hes a guy guy and has a lot of male friends. Come to find out this past weekend, he has been hanging out with his boss, and his other male friend from work, and his bosss 2 female sisters. A lot. Hes never *once* mentioned them before. My BF is 38 they are 29, I turned 30 this summer. In case anyone in curious about ages. My boyfriend told me that his boss invited us to his house Saturday night for a cook out, and in the car ride on the way mentioned that his bosss 2 sisters would be there. Of course I didnt think anything of it at that point, nor care. Its normal for a bunch of people you dont know to be at gatherings. However within a few minutes of arriving, it became clear that they had met before (again that didnt ring a bell per-say, maybe he met them at his work being their his bosses sisters). I dont of course expect my boyfriend to tell me-every-single-time he meets a new person. What became clear as the night went on was that he knew one of the sisters particularly *well*. Im just going to bullet point these in order but this is what I noticed throughout the night ~She mentioned several times said she had put together a bag of hand me downs for his daughter. He acted somewhat nonchalant/ uncomfortable about it, maybe because I was there? (Theres no HARM in his daughter getting clothes, of course. This just came as a surprise because again I did not know she existed prior, and to me shows a level of familiarity between them). ~He had shared 2 Instagram accounts with her, of which they talked about (dont shoot me for including this, its just all what I observed) ~Had inside jokes about the last time he was over at his bosses house for a bonfire (one of the times he said it was just the guys/ she was omitted) ~When she was FaceTiming her 4 yr old son goodnight, she said her son wanted to say goodnight to my boyfriend, so he did ~She joked a few times about how my boyfriend and her had a similar sense of humor ~I found out that the week or so after my boyfriend broke up with me, he went out to dinner with his boss, and her. He told that he had no idea she was going to be there. Im wondering if it was a set up/ blind date kind of thing ~she joked about a matching tattoo they were going to get (including his boss/ her brother) but made lots of comments about it to my bf ~Recently, as in 3 weeks ago prior to this cookout, my boyfriend told me he met his boss at a brewery, then went to another brewery, then out to a nice dinner afterwards. I found out she was also there the whole day. He said again he didnt know she was going to show up. The next day when I had asked him how the brewery tour with his boss went, he said it was great, said his boss had never gone to this restaurant before so they went had good wine etc. Never ONCE mentioned that he spent the entire day with her there too. I am TRYING not to feel off about this. But its SO hard given the past history, and the basic violation of trust I have with my boyfriend. Theres also a million ways to justify what I noticed as well, and look at it like, why cant they just be friendly to each other? It doesnt mean anything Etc. What bothers me is not her personally, but his *absolute* omission of her. When they clearly know each other well enough. He talks about his boss all the time, never ONCE mentioning this girl. When I asked my boyfriend in the car on the way home why he never brought her up before, he didnt really have a response at all. He was quiet for awhile, and then defensively sounding said because it wasnt important / he didnt know she was going to be there. Thats fine! But still, why totally omit her for MONTHS? This past week I went away to visit my dad and he texted me that Saturday night he went out to eat with his work friend and this girl. He at least TOLD me about it this time, but why only hang out with her while Im away? If only for the fact that he knows how uncomfortable I am about it. I feel like its complete disregard for my feelings. He also knows hes getting a second chance after the break up. I just keep going back and forth and I just cant shake my gut feeling about this.

He also didnt like the way the conversation went and we agreed that we should sit down and talk with him again. Aside from the excuses and non-apologies we all kept getting sidetracked mostly due to the fact that the conversation took place at 11pm and lasted until after 1am. Overall we dont feel the first conversation was very productive. We do not agree however on how things should be moving forward after our next conversation. I wish I had known we werent on the same page before the first conversation because that was not fun for me to be totally blindsided by DH (he tried to play both sides and it made me feel like the bad guy). What I would like to happen moving forward: - the bare minimum as far as contact with HBIL. Id say no contact but as I have stated it isnt possible since DHBFF is HBILs roommate and we would have to see him at family events. - major info diet for his entire family, no one is told any private info about our marriage, the kids, our health, our jobs, or my family. They all love to gossip so even if we didnt tell HBIL certain things there is a good chance hed still find out, not to mention MIL (BrokeSnob for those on JustNoMil) will complain about how I do things so I feel its best not to give anyone any info. - strip HBILs title as our oldest sons godfather as he has lost that privilege. Neither of our sons are baptized so it wouldnt be a complicated thing to do (we plan to teach them about the different religions and let them choose when their older, the godparents we pick are people we would like to support and guide them on their journey). What he would like to happen moving forward: - for the next 3 months minimal contact, after that steadily increase contact every 2-3 months. - info diet on our private lives. Hes not involved in ours, were not involved in his. - open and honest communication from all of us. Im very frustrated and upset. Im tired of going in circles with HBIL, and allowing him to continue to hurt me. DH doesnt want to cut him out(as much as we can) because family hes my brother I owe it to him to try to work this out, he also likes to ask me if it was your sister would you cut her out? My response is always it would be hard but Id do it if it would protect our family from toxic people. Overall I know a lot of this is his decision because if I tried to push him or put my foot down its only going to make things worse and him resent me. I told him if thats how he wanted to deal with it then I have some ground rules: -our marriage, and our decisions as partners and parents are respected not just by HBIL but by his family as well. - info diet on my life (nothing more than shes doing good, unless I tell HBIL), our marriage, and the boys. -I will not go out of my way to talk to HBIL or spend time with him, but I will not go out of my way to avoid him either. -like with MIL I will not be friends with HBIL on Facebook or any other media platforms but I wont block him. Im going to add this one: - HBIL can only see the boys if he is granted permission from both of us. Honestly I dont know what else to do at this point. Its going to be quite a while before we sit down with HBIL again though in general with DHs work schedule getting busier with the holiday season, stuff with our apartment I have to take care of (we recently got new owners), the holiday season in general (we have large families), and now recently DHs grandpas (MILs step dad) health has started on a major decline, hes now in a nursing home and from what I know all they can do is make him comfortable. DH is torn up and honestly Im not doing to good myself. SGFIL is the only person who has ever treated me like family and accepted me as one of his own (aside from the fact that we are distantly related. Again he is not DHs bio grandpa so no DH and I are not related). So yah it probably wont be until after Christmas at the very least before we have the second conversation.

Hey yall I'm a 23 y/I trans gal and while it's always been an idea in my head, I only recently started looking into the possibility of me having ADHD-PI. As I looked and looked and did self-diagnostic type questionnaires (and got in touch with my roommates cousin, an ADHD coach) I checked off the boxes and felt that I met all the diagnostics in the DSM V as well, the constant forgetting, constant thoughts interrupting thoughts, interrupting people, saying things out loud immediately because if not you'll forget it, and such. I guess a little backstory: I have very little definitive recollection of my childhood, other than some times with friends or pets or on vacations, I don't remember. I was moved into gifted classes in 3rd grade, I did really well in elementary and middle school (2nd-6th grade) I got my first B in a report card in 6th grade and was incredibly upset. My memory really picks up in highschool, I did a bunch of things because my parents were always pushing me to be active in clubs, Key Club, Band, Ultimate Frisbee, Student Council, Student Ambassadors. At home when I was studying, I would study well because my parents would walk in and check to see if I was working regularly. I'm almost positive the reason I was ever really productive was because there was consequence associated with not being productive, for not doing good enough. Often though, I'd distract myself reading random Wikipedia pages for a while and then be miffed about the time that I lost. My phone played into this also, it's so much harder to focus when you can pick up a pocket computer with things that are interesting. A common trend I remember was, in the classes I wasn't interested in and would have to try, mostly math, I struggled to even start studying, to do anything. By mid semester, I'd almost always have a C which for me was unacceptable, and by the end of the semester I was almost always able to pull it up to a B. Generally though, I liked a lot of my classes in high school and nothing was too difficult, so I never had to really focus that hard, save for the classes mentioned above. I graduated highschool top 5% of my class. Then I went off to college. First year was no problem, nothing was hard I didn't need to focus, the material wasn't interesting, but it was easy, finished the year with a 3.91. I had been horribly depressed the whole time, and transferred. As a geology major I took mineralogy and enjoyed it a lot, I was one of the only people to get an A in the class. Every geology class after that, I had no interest in and couldn't pay attention to for the life of me. I'd write the notes I heard without thinking and drift in and out of the lecture. 2.5 years of disinterest (and a field camp) later and I change my major. Again I have a few classes I love and do great in them, but the classes that required me to buckle down, I couldn't and my grades continued to slip between my fingers while I feel like I'm just idly watching. So I wanted to try and figure this out. Prompting me to find this sub and reading other people writing my normal day experiences. So I went today to my psychiatrist and upon mentioning it, he printed out 2 papers. Adult ADHD Self-Diagnostic screening, and another about childhood. I can't remember my childhood and struggled to answer most of the whole thing and essentially guessed based on what I've heard about me as a kid. but then answered the Adult one and everything was Often/Very Often. My psychiatrist didn't look at the adult one save for a slight glance because he immediately dismissed it because the paper for childhood didn't show ADHD symptoms, so I couldn't have ADHD. And while I kind of wanted to ask a few questions, the way my doctor said it was in the matter of fact, we're done here kind of way. I'm confused and I feel strongly that I have ADHD-PI and am overwhelmed with everything that I don't care about crashing down on me as the semester rolls forward. And now, I'm not sure about me having ADHD, something I felt pretty confident that I have. I'm gonna be seeking a second opinion but I'm not sure where and how I can do that. And since I got that kind of reaction the first time, why would it be any different. TL;DR: Sorry for the wall, I just kinda got going. But 23 y/o trans gal struggling with college because she has to try, I have to put effort into things and struggle to do so. Saw my psych, he dismissed it quickly after questions about my childhood that I can't remember.

This is going to be a bit confusing but Ill explain as best as I can. Also, I was 15 when this happened and the person Im talking about knew my age so please keep this in mind. Sorry for my rambling but I just need to get this off my chest. I cosplay heavily from Love Live, which is an anime basically about a singing girl group (think of a KPop group but anime and Japanese) performing. The show itself is very innocent and fun, and the fans are very intense. Numerous cosplayers, include myself, like to form groups to just have fun and perform the songs at different events related to the show (think conventions). The act itself is very innocent and fun, and Ive met some of my greatest friends through these groups. One of the first groups I was in I was friends with all the members. We were all like a family and even though I no longer am with them, I am very close to them and still hang out with them. One of the members cosplayed You, but if you dont know who it is just know he cosplayed the character that my character was commonly shipped with. He was a guy, but since he said he was gay and hadnt done anything creepy yet I didnt mind being in a group with him. Everything was very wholesome and innocent at first, and we had fun every practice with the rest of the members. I never really interacted with him exclusively, but one thing I noted was that he was very touchy. I took it as a platonic thing since I myself am a hugger, but in hindsight it was a LARGE red flag. He once even grabbed my butt but apologized and claimed it was an accident, but I dismissed it. First performance comes and everything goes smoothly. He later starts to say that he loves me which I, once again, take in a platonic way like one may say I love you to their best friend, so I just kinda laugh and go haha [name] love ya too! I talk to the other members more because Im closer to them but I talk to him every now and then and we prepare for the next performance. Next performance comes and we all decided to do a cosplay photoshoot before hand. I get a few solo photos when he asks if we can do some more shippy photos, since a lot of people ship (think my character and his character should date in the show). I am uncomfortable with this and tell him no, and he asks again. I just awkwardly excuse myself and then just ignore him till the performance where I leave immediately afterwards to hang out with my friends. Due to unrelated circumstances, I leave the group. Im still on friendly terms with everyone including him, and text everyone regularly. Fast forward to early October, where their next performance took place. I was performing with another group and briefly talked to them, where we all talked and joked about old times. Eventually I perform and then leave and dont see him for the rest of the convention. A week later I notice my old group releases a statement that their old You (the guy) has been removed and they are looking for a new one. Confused, I DM them asking what happened and holy shit. To summarize, he was groping many of the female members and claimed he was gay to them. Following my leaving, two more guy members joined and he told them he was straight, which was a HUGE red flag. Apparently at the convention he was stalking cosplayers and grabbing people without consent. He pulled similar things he did to me (like being overly touchy) to people who were younger than me. He even stalked a cosplayer until the point where she had to hide in a bathroom for an hour at the convention. I was at first very surprised but slowly things clicked and I realized that he was giving off weird vibes the whole time. I then remembered a time when he offered me his hotel room to change cosplays in at a convention but I immediately said no because that thought made me very uncomfortable. I felt violated and disgusted knowing that if I had said yes and trusted him like I used to, he wouldve or couldve pulled some serious shit on me.

I know that in theory, I should not be using them but the blanket keeps me warm at night and the flannels when I go outside. I realize the most unconscionable thing to do would be to give them away or donate them, but another factor I have to consider is that I am a student at the moment and short on money to comfortable afford replacements for these items at the moment.

I was nervous because I dont like it when anyone looks through my stuff. He said I seemed nervous and started browsing through my apps. I felt bad when someone looked into my phone, and asked him to stop, but he refused. I started laughing nervously and I was getting increasingly nervous, I asked for my phone back but he didnt give it to me. In the end I yanked my phone off his hands and left. He followed me and asked for it saying I was hiding something. He said my reaction proved I was guilty. I said Im hiding nothing, but you know I hate it when anyone looks in my phone. He asked for my passcode and I refused to give it. He got mad very quick, said I either gave him the code or I had to leave. I refused to give the code, so he made me leave. Our dog tried to follow me but he refused to let me have him. I was crying and telling him I wasnt hiding anything, and I only wanted my privacy to be respected, but he was very mad and asked me to leave and never come back. I left my phone at home. When I came back two hours later, he had taped a sign to the door that said I said never come back. I went in anyway and he was trying to hack my phone to look into it. He asked for the code again and I refused. I told him I wasnt hiding anything, that he was being abusive and he should trust me. Then I went to the bedroom to find all my clothes, everything that belongs to me, on the floor. All my boxes opened. It broke my heart because I spent a long time organizing all of my stuff, and it made me cry. He refused to give me my phone and kept telling me I was hiding something because I could end this all by just giving him the passcode, but I was refusing, so it meant I was hiding something. He said you know I would forgive anything you did, but I need to know. I told him I knew he would forgive anything, which is why he should believe I didnt want to show my phone because I wanted privacy. But he refused to hear me out. He is way stronger than I am physically, so I tried to yank the phone off his hands and he was able to push me away. He got a crowbar that was on the floor after we did some repair and said he would use it on me if I tried again. I tried again and he didnt use it but was able to push me away. Then he threatened to kick out my cats if I didnt leave or give him the passcode. I didnt want to give him the passcode, but I didnt want to leave or have him kick my inside cats out. He refused to believe when I said I hadnt done anything and I was only standing up for myself. He brought one of my cats in a carrier and said he was taking her outside if I didnt leave, so I went outside. I went outside but I had nowhere to go so I came back in. Again he confronted me on the way in and I tried to hit him, which Im not proud of, and he yanked my hair in return. I went to the bedroom and he followed me again and said I was trying to hide something, and I lost it completely and told him I was standing up for myself, because I had the right to have my privacy, and I needed to feel like an adult and not a child. He calmed down suddenly and went to the door. He started crying and gave me back my phone and said he wanted to kill himself. When I asked why, he said that he knew I had cheated on him. When I asked when, because Im with him almost all the time, he said I did on vacation. I took a trip without him this year because I badly needed a vacation but he had to stay in town. While I was gone, we spoke whenever he wanted to, and I was constantly on the road, so I wouldnt have had the time to do anything anyway. Yet he is adamant that I cheated on him and says he feels it in his bones. He says there was a breach of trust because I had Tinder on my phone last year. What happened last year is that we talked about having an open relationship and he said ok, said he didnt want to have one, but he would let me do whatever I want. Weeks later he found out I had tinder (I mentioned it) and he lost his mind with jealousy. So I deleted the app and never got it again. He apologized a few days later saying he had no reason to be so jealous when he allowed me to do what I wanted, but I had already lost my interest because of the trouble it created, so I didnt seek a partner again. I tell him theres no reason for him to believe I cheated, but he says he feels it in his bones. I dont know what to do, I am very hurt. On top of this, when I was a kid I was accused by my mother (who was very abusive) of having stolen something, and was harassed for weeks because she said I looked guilty. I reminded him this story today, since its a memory that has been hurting me immensely for years, but he didnt care.

It was an \"on us\" check written out to cash from her elderly mother for $40, and she handed us the check with her license too so it seemed like she knew the drill. She was at our tube. My bank charges a $6 fee to non-customers that cash checks with us. Though she seemed to be used to how we operate I made sure to remind her of the fee; boy did she throw a fit. She says that she's been able to cash checks with us \"for years\" without a fee, which would be astounding in itself if true but I find very hard to believe considering that our tellers would need a supervisor's override to complete the transaction every time. So to think that our tellers would get that override without even mentioning the fee to her is unbelievable in the most literal sense of the word, but I digress. I spoke to my assistant manager and she gave me the go ahead to cash the check without the fee. Then I told the lady in the most patient and precise way that I could muster, given how silly this situation was, that I got my boss' approval and she doesn't have to worry about the fee today and that I had her $40 with two $20 bills to give her just like how she wanted. THEN she got super skeptical of me for some reason I cannot explain. She asked \"Well what happened to the $6?\" I repeated \"The fee was waived today ma'am I got my supervisor's approval\" \"Did you just take it from my mother's account??\" \"No... I wouldn't... be able to do that without your mother's permission...\" \"Yeah, ok, sure....\" Then she drove off. NOT EVEN FIVE MINUTES LATER her mother called our branch demanding an explanation as to why we charged her account the $6 fee, luckily my assistant manager was there to answer the phone because I would not be able to hold it together. Why in the WORLD would we charge OUR customer for YOUR fee?? What part of \"you don't have to worry about the fee today\" is so difficult to understand?? MAYBE go to your own bank to cash a check???? Ok, ranting aside, this was a very funny experience for me, I've only been a teller for 4 months now, and this is only the first one of \"these\" I've had to deal with. TLDR: Non-customer wanted to cash a check ($6 fee for that). Didn't want the fee, so we waived it. Thought we took the $6 from our customer's(her mother's) account to cover the fee.

The basket would be an infinite use item that would allow a person to hold either 5 mushrooms, or 5 apples. This is 25 shield or 25 health that can be carried or eaten on go, one by one. I imagine the time to consume one apple or mushroom would be the same 1 second time that it takes to eat one off the ground. I think the idea is pretty balanced in itself because you would have to give up an inventory slot, and find the apples or mushrooms. The fact that the basket would have infinite uses balanced with these negative aspects, I feel.

My boyfriend was hesitant to date because of our age difference (I'm 23, he's 32) and the fact that he is still living at his mom's house while pursuing his Ph.D.--he said this would definitely cause problems in the future, and I didn't believe him, but he was right. Sex history: In the beginning of our relationship, the sexual tension was super high, and we'd get freaky any chance we got, any time or place. This constant need to be on each other at all times tapered off a little (as is natural), but our sex life came to a screeching hault once my mom started to give us shit for \"banging in her house all the time\". My mom was joking (she really doesn't care), but it really hit my boyfriend's pride. Now he doesn't want to have sex anywhere that's not our own place due to pride, so we've decided not to have sex until one of us has our own apartment (luckily, I happen to be graduating/getting my own place over the summer). So, we haven't had sex in 3 months. I hated it at first--At this age, I'm very HL. This also killed my confidence for a little bit. But, I've gotten used to it. My boyfriend insists that he really wants to have sex, but I suppose his pride surpasses his libido. He has also complained that his libido has been low recently, but this is likely due to high stress from school (it's been an intense semester). Also, I think this sexual hiatus is easier on him, because he went without sex for several years straight (intentionally went abstinent to focus on school). Potential negative effects: I feel like not having sex has affected me negatively--I'm already really shy to initiate sex (although I am HL), and I feel like the lack of sex is going to make me even more scared once given the opportunity to have sex again. We've lost a bit of intimacy in our relationship--we don't even make out anymore, I don't know if this is to avoid getting horny or what. I feel comfortable around him, but not to the fullest extent yet (hard for me to be fully comfortable with people due to Social Anxiety), and I feel like I would be 100% comfortable if we were having sex regularly. I'm also scared that my boyfriend may become so used to not having sex, that he'll be really LL by the time we can start having sex again. Potential positive effects: I feel like we've bonded differently than couples in other relationships do, because our intimacy lies only in the time spent together, conversation, innocent physical touches like cuddling, etc.--not in our sexual compatibility. So perhaps once we begin having sex again, we will have like the ultimate relationship, lol. TL;DR: Boyfriend and I have decided to be abstinent until one of us has our own apartment.

We went on a few dates and thought we were having a good time. But then I got the radio silence treatment when trying to set up another date. Which is fine; I've been ghosted before it's not the end of the world. Some people just don't have the courage to be honest and break it off. Except when she finally did get back to me, she made up a bullshit lie about being in the hospital. I won't go into the full story about how I knew she was lying, but essentially she contradicted herself with a few different excuses. Anyways, like I said, whatever. Not the first time I've been ghosted and rejected. But what was really annoying about this one was that I had matched with this girl like 6 months ago and she essentially did the same thing back then. We hadn't actually gotten together back then, but it was the same thing with a few days of good conversation and then silence. So I called her out on it and essentially just told her that, for future reference, most guys would rather she just be honest because the ghosting thing is lame and immature. She didn't take that well, but after paying for 3 dates and to be treated like that (for a second time), fuck it... Anyways, the dating game is about learning and growing.

Just want to get it out since I feel like I can't tell anyone anything. A few months ago I asked one of my friends if she wanted to try sex because we were both virgins. Like something you see in fiction, it worked and eventually we started fucking every week/every other week as **friends**. I made this as clear as possible from the get go so there were no misconceptions. Anyway, after 2 months of this while keeping it top secret from everyone we know (still in education), I started feeling guilty as I actually had strong feelings for another girl. This other girl is also best friends with the girl I was fucking. It got to the point where I liked this girl too much, and was honest with the girl I was fucking and told her that I had feelings for her friend. She started crying, told me that she caught feelings for me and sort of said \"well I don't know about you, but when you're having sex with someone you develop feeling for them\" however for me, this was not the case and I always thought of us are friends, nothing more. She also went on to say she felt guilty fucking me, but when I asked why she sort of just said \"idk\". After that I cheered her up a bit, we walked around and hung out for a couple hours laughing and joking like friends, then I walked her home and that was it. I'd got it off my chest after months of liking this other girl. Fast forward to now, about 2 weeks later. We haven't spoken to each other. I've been talking to the girl I'm into like I have for months, just friends. I'm scared to tell her how I feel, and honestly I don't think I want to because I feel trapped. If she doesn't like me back, our friendship will be ruined and if she does, the girl I was seeing will be devastated, and will end up hating the girl I like, despite them being best friends. The most annoying part is I'm pretty sure the girl I'm into likes me too. I catch her glancing at me, and we often look at each other in class and smile. She's always laughing around me (she does this with other people too, however), always teasing me about stuff and the other day we hung out as friends out of class and she was more than comfortable with coming back to mine to hang out. We text nearly every day, often her starting the conversations more than I do. I feel there is something \"there\" when we're together but i can't tell. It feels extra shit because the girl I was seeing is talking to the girl I'm into like nothing happened, she plays a bigger facade than I do, but secretly we were fucking each other until this whole shit storm happened. I feel like shit. I can't tell anyone about the girl I was seeing as we agreed we wouldn't, but now I feel like she hates me and I'm wondering if i'm in the wrong. I sent her a message asking her something the other day and she left me on read. Should I have kept quiet and continued to have sex with her despite liking her friend?

I feel like I can't trust/tell anyone anything and if I do, it'll back fire tremendously.", "label": "1"}, {"post": "Sandra, Lydia, or Susie? Let's take a look at each of them: Sandra: Was the tribe's primary target because she barely talked to anybody, didn't do anything around camp except cook the rice, and was the least help in challenges. Her tribe ends up winning the first two challenges in come-from-behind victories and then the target shifts to the bigger threats. Post-merge also saw a ridiculous amount of luck with Burton (who had previously hardly talked strategy without Jon's permission) deciding to tell Lil they were targeting Darrah before going on a boat trip and leaving Sandra all alone to get into Lil's head (Sandra admitted had it not been for Burton making that strategic error than she would have gone home that week). Also, who knows how the game would have played without the Outcasts twist but that also very well could have contributed to Sandra's win. I love Sandra but the amount of luck she got in PI was astronomical! Lydia: 4'10\" woman who describes herself pre-game as shy and was not at all physically good (except for in the water). Her CBS profile also shows she really didn't \"understand\" the game and want to play it strategically. She was then put on the bad tribe in the most lopsided tribal divide in Survivor history. She was on the outside of her tribe when not included in a six-person alliance and her tribe by all means should have lost the first IC had it not been for Judd getting the other's tribes waters mixed up and coincidentally all the tribe's strongest members drank from the water Judd accidentaly contaminated. Lydia is still on the bottom, really does nothing to save herself, but with 10 minutes left until Tribal Brian overhears Morgan say she wants to target a guy (not sure which guy but suspected to be Gary?). Brian immediately tries to save Lydia and somehow it works flawlessly. Lydia survives the next tribal as the tribe feels Brianna is the weakest member (probably a lot of that had to do with the fact that Brianna and Jamie both got sick after putting what they believed to be salt on their corn). Lydia is next to go but there's a tribe swap and she's all of a sudden in the numbers. Her tribe loses the first immunity but Judd decides to side with her alliance (not because of her doing but because he didn't like his old tribe and was on the bottom). I'm not sure who would have gone home next tribal but I there's a good chance it would have been Lydia to keep the tribe's strength up. Two votes later and the tribes merge, Lydia is in the majority so she goes to the final four before being voted out for being a threat in the final vote. Susie: An overweight woman who does no physical activity and pre-game says that she talks too much and her edicate isn't the best. She ends up on a terrible tribe and likely would have been second booted had it not been for her having one of the worst people to ever play the game on her tribe (Michelle). She also lucked out with having Gillian on her tribe. So now there's nobody to hide behind and Susie is almost certainly going next and her tribe is behind in IC (largely because of her) but Ken comes from behind and wins it. The tribes than swap and Susie is on the bottom and had her tribe lost any IC she goes home pre-merge. Luckily they don't and the only time they go to Tribal they get rid of Dan, sweet guy but also not a great Survivor player, as they feel he's the bigger threat and they don't need to keep him any more for challenge strength. The tribes should have merged and Susie gone home not long after but instead the producers decide they don't want it to be a predictable Pagonging (since when have the producers been against having an alpha-male win the game, let alone an extremely likeable one like Marcus?). Despite the other tribe wanting to throw the challenge, it ends up being one where only one person is necessary to win the challenge and Matty does. They now merge and Susie is in the numbers. At final 4 she's supposed to go home but somehow wins the IC so she's in the FTC and somehow despite having a terrible social game is one vote away from winning. I love all three of these women but the amount of luck they got is just ridiculous in their seasons. Personally I would say Lydia is the luckiest, had Guatemala been played 100 times she goes home first 97 times I feel like. Then again, I guess you could say she was unlucky to be put on such an incompetent tribe.

Battle for Azeroth is now on the eve of ending and we are getting ready to venture forth into a new adventure. Shadowlands will be releasing about a day and a half from now, and I wanted to do one final video on specific Battle for Azeroth gold making. Today, we are going to be talking about what I found to be the most profitable zone in all of BFA for farming for one very specific reason..Stormsong Valley. Of course Stormsong Valley has all of the hallmarks of a good farming area already.just as all of the zones in Battle for Azeroth have. There are herbs, ores, things to skin, and places to fish. The one thing that sets this zone apart from the rest and make it such a great farm are the jelly nodes that you can collect once you have unlocked the Honeyback Hive faction. These jelly nodes are found all around the map and not only can you use them to increase your reputation with the Honeyback Hive..you can sell them. Now why would someone want this reputation.well if you want a Bee mount, you are going to have to grind to exalted, which I can tell you from experience is very tedoious. It will take a ton of jelly to level up and you are going to be gathering a lot. Initially the farm is a HUGE pain because the nodes dont show up on your mini map. You have to fly around and actually look at the ground to find them. One big tip for this is to turn you ground clutter down as far as it will go. It may look pretty, but it can be a pretty big pain in the butt to see the jelly lying on the ground. The good news is that once you get to revered, you will get some goggles that will allow you to see nodes on the mini map. This is when things get a lot easier for you and truly makes the farm great. I personally always like to turn my jelly into the highest version, which is Royal Jelly, before posting it on the auction house. They seem to sell the best and often have the least competition. Even though Battle for Azeroth will be ending, I actually think that this will be an even better farm going forward. Not only will everyone have moved on to Shadowlands, leaving it wide open for us..but you know that there are going to be people who see the mount and start digging into what it takes to get it. They can either go back and farm old content for hours and hours on end.or they can just buy your conveniently placed jelly off of the auction house. If you are already a double gatherer, this farm can even be that much better. I can easily make 30-60k gold in an hour from this farm. That does of course depend on selling the materials, which always seem to sell within the day in my experience. I spent many an hour circling around Stormsong, and I hope you find some enjoyment out of it as well.", "label": "0"}, {"post": "I ordered some items using Afterpay and ended up returning a few items in store.

I have been among the many readers of Homestuck since 2014, and have a great love for the aforementioned multimedia extravaganza that we have all come to know very well. One of the things I love most about Homestuck is it's mutation into this \"great riddle\". My enjoyment of a good mystery knows no bounds and I've been known to go straight off the handle in regards to my sleuthing of various mysteries. With that being said, I'm also an obsessive archivist. This could be for many reasons pertaining to my life; I'm not a psychologist, and if I was I probably wouldn't be a very good one. In my years browsing all of the content Homestuck has graciously fed us through the broader end of a garden hose, I've always wanted an ULTIMATE omnibus of the canonical and meta-canonical events that took place in/around Homestuck so as to better research this \"great riddle\". Resources like the MSPA Wiki and [Homestuck.net]( do a pretty good job of this, but not an unequivocally perfect job. (Not trying to discredit either resource at all, they both are both an incredibly cool arm of this community). I believe rather firmly that all of the pieces are there, they just need to be assembled appropriately. If anyone would like to take part in this adventure, I'd love to get a team together to accomplish such a task. Would anyone be interested? As a small footnote, I'm being a little theatrical about my goal; I fully understand that Hussie [loves]( [to]( [troll]( his fans.

The tests I've done: 1) Fill up a measuring cup with water, dump it into an empty glass. Twice.

After playing Apex Legends for two hours the system locked up whilst accessing the Radeon software. The problem slowly got worse to the point where I could not get past the Windows welcome screen without a crash. Cut to three days of troubleshooting later I had tested each part trying to find the issue, both my SSD and Hard Drive were both working fine, and my GPU also appeared to be working as intended. I got it down to it either being the RAM or the Motherboard. Yesterday I tested each stick of RAM with Memtest86, testing them separately I got 0 issues and errors for both sticks. I then proceeded to boot the system first with just one stick and then again with two and have had no crashes since. So my question is, could Memtest86 have fixed something even though no errors where shown? I got tech support from a friend who is much more knowledgeable than me and this problem has completely stumped him too. I now have to decide if I should return either the RAM or the Mobo, or assume that it is now working and proceed to use the system as normal? Thanks in advance.", "label": "0"}, {"post": "Hi guys!

I work Monday through Friday 8-4ish and our routine has been the same since before I started back to work (this is just a GENERAL idea not a rigid schedule- he is fed on demand but it is typically 3 hours between feeds/bottles, asleep by 9pm, up at 5am) Up at 5 am to breastfeed (usually a long, big feed) and goes right back to sleep. I pump after this feed to top off his bottles for the day and was getting 1-3 oz off of one breast last month, now its only 1 oz off both) 7:45 Babysitter arrives and I leave for work. I usually pump on the way in or right when I get to work (I have a closed office and can pump pretty much whenever luckily). I should add that I usually pump at least 15 minutes but more often 20 minutes using an Elvie hands free pump. I have compared breastmilk output with my Medela Pump in Style and I get the same output. 8:30 Baby wakes up, has a 4oz bottle. 12:30 4oz bottle, mom pumps. 3:30 4oz bottle, mom pumps. 4:30 Mom home, feed on demand until bed time (usually 2 feeds at 5:30ish, 8:30ish) 9:00pm sleep The last week though I have been noticing my breasts are less full in the morning and I am struggling to make 4oz bottles for the next day. I have added in a pump after he feeds and goes to bed and I only get 1 oz from both breasts. His first morning feed used to be one breast and a little from the other side, and I would pump the rest of the second side to get 2-3oz. Now I pump both and I barely can get an ounce! And my daily output is dropping. My son is wetting diapers, gaining weight (a bit slower than the first 3 months but I had an overactive letdown and what I thought was a little oversupply so he gained QUICK), and seems happy, although maybe a bit frustrated in the evenings when my flow is slower. I did a weighted feed last week and he took over 4 oz at the 5:30pm feeding even though I felt like my breasts were empty. We just transitioned out of a swaddle in the last two weeks into a sleep sack and he has been waking up a couple times at night when he knocks his pacifier out with his hands, maybe 2-3 times, but falls right back asleep when I put the pacifier back in. I am drinking lots of water, coconut water, taking Legendairy supplements, eating oatmeal almost every day, taking vitamins. Should I try to add in another breastfeeding and if so, when? Should I attempt to feed him in the middle of the night when he wakes up? I am hesitant to do the latter because he was sleeping so well before the swaddle transition.

Greeting him are a harem of naked whores, moaning his name. Their wet pussies dripping with anticipation. His cock stirs with lust and he slowly stumbles towards their promise of paradise.* *Back in the real world the hero pulls down his pants and drops his sword and torch, as he slowly stumbles into the darkness with a stupid drooling grin on his face....* Hey there! So as you can see I really like scenarios like this, where a guy starts seeing hallucinations and illusions of his lustful desires. Being tricked by them and happily giving him, only for it to end badly for him. In that little intro I wrote I imagine that the pink mist is a defensive mechanism put there by the owner of the dungeon to lead heroes to their deaths.

I'm not really into snuff, nothing too visceral or painful, but seeing a hero being happily led by his cock into dangerous situations that end in his death is something I love. One thing I'd like to include is cutting back and forth between the illusionary world and the real world. Seeing the hero in both, and how he's really just being tricked the entire time. The illusions being sexy, opulent and happy. Reality being dark, lonely and sad. Now with all that being said, I don't want to continue the intro where it left off.
